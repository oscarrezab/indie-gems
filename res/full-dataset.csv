We had a fight on the promenade out in the rain
She said she loved me, but she had somewhere to go
She couldn't scream while I held her close
I swore I'd never let her go

Tell me what you wanna know
Come on, come on
There ain't no motive for this crime
Jenny was a friend of mine
Come on, come on, yeah

I know my rights, I've been here all day and it's time
For me to go, so let me know if it's alright
I just can't take this, I swear I told you the truth
She couldn't scream while I held her close
I swore I'd never let her go

Tell me what you wanna know
Come on, come on

While he's having a smoke and she's taking a drag
Now they're going to bed and my stomach is sick
And it's all in my head, but she's touching his

Chest now, he takes off her
Dress now, let me go
And I just can't look, it's killing me
They're taking control

Jealousy, turning saints into the sea
Swimming through sick lullabies, choking on your alibis
But it's just the price I pay, destiny is calling me
Open up my eager eyes, 'cause I'm Mr. Brightside

We lost track of the time
Dreams aren't what they used to be
Some things sat by so carelessly

Smile like you mean it
Smile like you mean it

And someone is calling my name
From the back of the restaurant
And someone is playing a game
In the house that I grew up in
And someone will drive her around
Down the same streets that I did
On the same streets that I did

A coffee shop with a cause, then I'll freak you out

Remember the arch of roses right above your couch?
Forget what they said in SoHo, leave the ""Oh, no""s out
Yes, there is an old cliche under your Monet, baby

What was it for?
In that old hallway, Mom says, ""Why don't you stay?
You've been away for a long time""

If my dreams for us can't get you through just one more day

And a little place that sits beneath the sky
She turned her face to speak but no-one heard her cry

Drive faster, boy
Drive faster, boy, ooh, yeah-ooh

I know there's a hope
There's too many people trying to help me cope
You got a real short skirt
I wanna look up, look up, look up, yeah, yeah
We were just in time
Let me take a little more off your mind
There's something in my head, somewhere in the back, saying
""We were just a good thing, we were such a good thing""

Make it go away without a word
But promise me you'll stay and fix these things I've heard

Oh, make it go away
Drive faster, boy, ooh, yeah-ooh
Oh, no

A crashing tide can't hide a guilty girl
With jealous hearts that start with gloss and curls
I took my baby's breath beneath the chandelier
Of stars in atmosphere and watched her disappear

Into the midnight show
Faster, faster, faster, faster, faster, faster
Oh no, no, no, no, no, no
No, no, no, no, no

Like something underground's going to come up and carry me
I've got this sentimental heart that beats
But I don't really mind that it's starting to get to me now

Why do you waste my time?
Is the answer to the question on your mind
And I'm sick of all my judges
So scared of what they'll find
But I know that I can make it
As long as somebody takes me home every now and then

Well have you ever seen the lights?
Have you ever seen the lights?

I took a shuttle on a shock wave ride
Where people on the pen pull the trigger for accolades
I took a bullet and I looked inside
Running through my veins an American masquerade

I still remember grandma Dixie's wake
I've never really known anybody to die before
Red, white and blue upon a birthday cake
My brother, he was born on the fourth of the July and that's all

So why do you waste my time?
Is the answer to the question on your mind
And I'm sick of all my judges
So scared of what they'll find
But I know that I can make it

Can we climb this mountain
I don't know
Higher now than ever before
I know we can make it if we take it slow
Let's take it easy
Easy now
Watch it go

We're burning down the highway skyline
On the back of a hurricane
That started turning
When you were young
When you were young

And sometimes you close your eyes
And see the place where you used to live
When you were young

They say the devil's water
It ain't so sweet
You don't have to drink right now
But you can dip your feet
Every once in a little while

You sit there in your heartache
Waiting on some beautiful boy to

But the message relayed is the same:
""Wait till tomorrow, you'll be fine.""
But it's gone to the dogs in my mind
I always hear them when the dead of night
Comes calling to save me from this fight
But they can never wrong this right

Don't you wanna come with me? Don't you wanna feel my bones
On your bones?
It's only natural
Don't you wanna swim with me? Don't you wanna feel my skin
On your skin?
It's only natural

(Never had a lover)
I never had a lover
(Never had soul)
I never had soul
(Never had a good time)
And I never had a good time
(Never got cold)
I never got gold

Don't you wanna come with me? Don't you wanna feel my bones
On your bones?
It's only natural
Don't you wanna swim with me? Don't you wanna feel my skin
On your skin?
It's only natural

Over the Sierra
Stranded on the heat wave
Burning with desire

Looking for a nightlife
Talked about the real thing
And drove into the fire
Headlights on the highway
The desert wind is howling
Rattlesnakes and romance
Are spilling with the rain
Candy apple red dress
Bleeding when she kissed me
Heaven in a rag top
Takes away my-my pain

When your highs are low

Move across the night like a separate wind

Pulled up to a motel
Vacancy was buzzing
Pink and dirty neon
Settled on the hood
Wrapped her arms around me
Come a little closer
Stumbled in the twilight
And fell onto the floor of the Mona Lisa
Dreaming of the free world
Lipstick on the nightstand
And demons at the door

When your chips are down
When your highs are low

Move across the night like a separate wind

When your hopes and dreams
Lose the will to go

A glorious existence
A simple celebration
A place you never been before

Tell me that you want it more

Some kind of slick chrome American prince
A blue jean serenade
Moon River what'd you do to me
I don't believe you

Saw Cinderella in a party dress but
She was looking for a night gown
I saw the devil wrapping up his hands
He's getting ready for the showdown
I saw the minute that I turned away
I got my money on a pawn tonight

The change came in disguise of revelation, set his soul on fire
She said she'd always knew he'd come around
And the decades disappear like sinking ships, but we persevere
God gives us hope, but we still fear what we don't know
The mind is poison
Castles in the sky sit stranded vandalized
We're drawbridges closing

Saw Cinderella in a party dress
But she was looking for a nightgown
I saw the devil wrapping up his hands
He's getting ready for the showdown
I saw the ending when they turned the page
I threw my money and I ran away
Straight to the valley of the great divide

Out where the dreams all hide
Out where the wind don't blow
Out here the good girls die
And the sky won't snow
Out here the bird don't sing
Out here the field don't grow
Out here the bell don't ring
Out here the bell don't ring
Out here the good girls die

Now Cinderella don't you go to sleep
It's such a bitter form of refuge
Why don't you know the kingdom's under siege
And everybody needs you
Is there still magic in the midnight sun
Or did you leave it back in sixty-one
In the cadence of a young man's eyes
Out where the dreams all hide"

But that ain't much
We can't wait 'til tomorrow
You got to know that this is real, baby, why you want to fight it?
It's the one thing you can choose, oh!

We got engaged on a Friday night
I swore on the head of our unborn child
That I could take care of the three of us
But I got the tendency to slip when the nights get wild
It's in my blood
She said she might just runaway somewhere else
Someplace good

We can't wait 'til tomorrow
You got to know that this is real, baby, why you want to fight it?
It's the one thing you can choose
Let's take a chance baby, we can't lose

Ain't we all just runaways?
I knew it when I met you, I'm not going to let you runaway
I knew it when I held you, I wasn't letting go!

We used to look at the stars and confess our dreams
Hold each other 'til the morning light
We used to laugh, now we only fight
Baby are you lonesome now?

At night I come home after they go to sleep
Like a stumbling ghost, I haunt these halls
There's a picture of us on our wedding day
I recognize the girl but I can't settle in these walls

We can't wait 'til tomorrow
Oh, we're caught up in the appeal baby, why you wanna hide it?
It's the last thing on my mind (Why you want to hide it?)
I turn the engine over and my body just comes alive

Ain't we all just runaways?
I knew it when I met you, I'm not going to let you run away
I knew it when I held you, I wasn't letting go!

Oh! Oh! Oh!

Ain't we all just runaways?
Yeah, runaways
Ain't we all just runaways?
Yeah"

I carried the weight of our last fight
Elvis singing don't be cruel, and I wonder if you feel it too
It's like we're going under
Somewhere outside the lonely Esmeralda county line
The question of my heart came to my mind

If I go on with you (by my side)
Can it be the way it was?
When we met, did you forget all about those golden nights?

Maybe a thief stole your heart
Or maybe we just drifted apart
I remember driving in my daddy's car to the airfield
Blanket on the hood, backs against the windshield
Back then this thing was running on momentum, love and trust
That paradise is buried in the dust

If I go on with you (by my side)
Can it be the way it was?
When we met, did you forget all about those golden nights?
(The way it was, it was)

All of our plans have fallen through
Sometimes a dream don't come true

Darling! Darling!
If we go on
Can it be the way it was
When we met did you forget all about them golden nights?
If I go on with you by my side
Can it be the way it was
My heart is true, girl it's just you I'm thinking of
Can it be the way it was?

And there's another heart
That's fadin' in the light

Don't want your picture on my cell phone
I want you here with me
Don't want your memories in my head, no
I want you here with me

Spent the summer just layin' out in the sun
Time seems to move so slowly, when you're taking it as it comes
Maybe we were just too young
Your body was tan and your hair was long
You shot me a smile and my cares were gone
Fallin' in love filled my soul with fright
You said, ""Come on, babe, it'll be alright""
I must've been a fool to the bitter end
Now I hold on to hope that I'll have you back again

I'd bargain and I'd fight
But there's another world you're livin' in tonight

Don't want your picture on my cell phone
I want you here with me
I don't want your memory in my head, no
I want you here with me

Well, I saw you in a restaurant the other day
And instead of walkin' towards you, I ran away (ran away)
I keep on waitin' for you
For you to come around
Come around and say

I can feel it
Come on, show me where it hurts
Maybe I can heal it
Your feelings are your own
Now you keep them under lock and key
You got me driving through the streets
For an answer to the mystery

The willows still weep on Charleston Avenue
Outside that vacant Starlight Motel
I see you laughing with your girlfriends
Not a care in the world, not a burden on your mind
It was a matter of time

There's a panic in this house and it's bound to surface
Just walking through the front door makes me nervous
It's creeping up the floorboards, got me wondering where I stand
I cannot put out the fire, I got a book of matches in my hand

When we first met, headstrong and filled with doubt
Made just enough hustling tables that summer to take you out
I was falling back on forever
Then you told me about your heart
You laid it on the line
Laughing with your girlfriends
Not a care in the world, not a burden on your mind
(You laid it on the line)
It was just a matter, it was a matter of time

We found ourselves a place
We belong in it forever
Ain't that what it's all about?
Make the promise and keep it
Come hell or high water
We'd figure it out
It was the night, it was the moon
It was the green grass in the garden
The victory and the sin
I know you're weary, look at me
Flailing in the corner
Here's the towel
Go on, throw it in

It was a matter of time
Can't you see that it's tearing me up inside?
Look what's laying at our feet
That's the wreckage of broken dreams
And burned out halos
And it's here on our street"

The leather seats, the passage rite
I feel the heat, I see the light

Yeah, we were innocent and young

Cast out of the night
You got a foolish heart
So you took your place but the fall from grace
Was the hardest part
It feels just like a dagger buried deep in your back
You run for cover but you can't escape the second attack
Her soul was innocent, she kissed him and she painted it black
You should have seen your little face, burning for love
Holding on for your life

All that I wanted was a little touch
A little tenderness and truth, I didn't ask for much, no
Talk about being at the wrong place at the wrong time

But sometimes in dreams of impact I still hear
Miss Atomic Bomb, I'm standing here
Sweat on my skin
And this love that I've cradled
Is wearing thin (Miss Atomic Bomb)
But I'm standing here and you are too late
Your shock-wave whisper has sealed your fate

It feels just like a dagger buried deep in your back

Before life and the dream collide
Because the truth's gonna come and cut me open wide

You're joining the choir
With everybody singing out glory Hallelujah
The time came for your solo
But there was nowhere to hide
Here come the rising tide

And the company you keep
Where they plan your crucifixion as we speak
So baby, till life and the dream collide
There's going to be a mystery underneath those neon lights

If you can't decipher just who's on your side
You will not escape the rising of the tide

Can you tell me brother
Was I deceived or in denial?
I was there in the back of the room when you testified
With your pitchfork tongue you licked your lips and lied
We're never going to know how hard you cried
When you petitioned and your access was denied
Till the venom in your veins is satisfied
Till you suffocate and swallow down the pride

A million miles of freedom
A million miles of road
But I still don't know where to start
She wrote her number down
She gave it to me
They had to scrape me off the floor
In this transient town
Waiters and dealers trying to get their foot in the door
That night I called her, she said

Daddy, daddy, daddy, all my life
I've been trying to find my place in the world
(I said to her)
Baby, baby, babe I got all night
To listen to the heart of a girl

I can see the time dripping down the clock
We've been trying to hear that ancient refrain
It's the one that knows us when our heads are down
It reminds us of the place from where we came
Where we came

Daddy, daddy, daddy, all my life
I've been trying to find my place in the world
(I said to her)
Baby, baby, babe I got all night
To listen to the heart of a girl

What happened here? What is this world?
It's too far from the heart of a girl
A ripple in the water from the drop of a pearl
I'm on the shore waiting for the heart of a girl

Many doors
Knock on one
Standing still, time is raging
Staring down the mouth of 100,000 guns
You're still here, you're still here
I believe that we never have to be alone
Yes I believe it's just around the bend
You can hold it in, or you can scream it on the microphone
There is no end
There is no end

Deep in the night, I feel a presence
Of something that was long ago, told to me
There is a hand guiding the river
The river to wide open sea
And deep in my heart, in any game
On any mountain, no I'm not afraid
Standing on stone, you stand beside me
And honor the plans that were made"

And sometimes I have these nightmares, in the middle of the day
Where a hay-making gypsy just steals her away

There is no doubt about it
(No doubt about it)
I'm a slave to her shade of love

She's going to fly her over to England, put that sword on her shoulder, and knight her

I'm going to be her prize fighter
No label's going to change where she's from
I'm going to be her prize fighter
And I'm dancing to the beat of her drum

She's always on my side, rich or poor
She's with me all the way, to The Golden Door
My lioness, my pièce de résistance
My only way

I'm going to drive me an El Dorado
The color of her Monterey eyes
With twin bullet tail lights
And plates that read desire

I'm going to be her prize fighter

I'm going to be her prize fighter
Though the wind and the wolves may howl

Through the sunshine and through the rain
I'm going to be her prize fighter

When I take the stand, will he hold my hand?
Will my faith stand still or run away?
(Run away)

And the desert, it's a hell of a place to find heaven
Forty years lost in the wilderness, looking for God
And you climb to the top of the mountain
Looking down on the city where you were born
(Oh, the years since you left gave you time to sit back and reflect)

Better you than me (Better you than me)
Better you than me, yeah
Well, the holy night is upon you (Better you, better you)
Do you see both sides, do they shove you around?
Better you than me, Joseph (Better you than me)
Better you than me, Joseph, Joseph
Joseph, Joseph (Than me)
Better you than me (Better you, better you, better you than me)

Well, your eyes just haven't been the same, Joseph"

I saw a lovely señorita looking back at me
Named Guadalupe with big brown eyes
Boy what did you do this time?

Made my excuses and a beeline for the bedroom door
She was begging and a-pleading screaming ""Por favor
Mi cumpleaños stay with me
Baby it's cold outside""

We are living in a difficult time
We've been walking down a difficult line
Put your feet up baby it's Christmas time
Cumpleaños feliz
Happy Birthday Guadalupe

(Our time will come)
(We both hold on)

She gave me coffee and tortillas to console my head
Prepared the slippers on my feet before she made our bed
And blew the candles from her favorite cake
And we kissed beneath the mistletoe

I pulled her body close to mine and I had just one chance
I whispered ""Baby will you marry me for just one dance?""
Infatuation the things you say
I got scared and I left that night

We are living in a difficult time
We've been walking down a difficult line
Put your feet up baby it's Christmas time
Cumpleaños feliz
Happy Birthday Guadalupe

(Our time will come)
(We both hold on)

Deck the halls with rosaries
Wish upon a Christmas tree
Silent night please come to me
Bearing gifts from my... my Mexican angel

At night I wake up cold and lonely bursting at the seams
She haunts the early morning hours of December dreams
My Guadalupe with big brown eyes
I wanna break the spell tonight

'Cause we are living in a difficult time
We've been walking down a difficult line
Put your feet up baby it's Christmas time
Cumpleaños feliz
Happy Birthday Guadalupe

(Our time will come)
(We both hold on)

Happy Birthday Guadalupe"

Dear father in heaven
I'm not a praying man but if you're up there and you can hear me
Show me the way
I'm at the end of my road and I
Show me the way, oh God

No more trouble in this town
Silent night for a change
A brand new year coming up ahead
You know it's been so long since I rang one in
I close my eyes, think about the path I took
Just when I think these times have gotten the best of me

I can see my mother in the kitchen, my father on the floor
Watching television, ""It's A Wonderful Life""
Cinnamon candles burning, snowball fights outside
Smile below each nose and above each chin
Stomp my boots before I go back in

I wasted my wishes on Saturday nights
Boy, what I would give for just one more
I'd soften my heart, shock the world
Do you hear my voice?
Do you know my name?
Light my way, lift my head, light my way

I can see my mother in the kitchen, my father on the floor
Watching television, ""It's A Wonderful Life""
Cinnamon candles burning, snowball fights outside
Smile below each nose and above each chin
Stomp my boots before I go back in

Family all together, presents piled high
Frost on all the windows, what a wonderful night
Cinnamon candles burning, snowball fights outside
Smile below each nose and above each chin

So happy they found me
Love was all around me
Stomp my boots before I go back in"

Where the cattle are ""a-browsing"" and the Spanish ponies grow
Where the Northers ""come a-whistling"" from beyond the Neutral Strip
And the prairie dogs are sneezing, as if they had ""The Grip""
Where the coyotes come a-howling around the ranches after dark
And the bluebirds are a-singing to the lovely ""meadow lark""
Where the bighorns are a-grazing and the lonely plovers call —
It was there that I attended ""The Cowboys' Christmas Ball""
(Whoo!)

The boys had left the ranches and come to town in piles
The ladies — ""kind of scattering"" — had gathered in for miles
The room was togged out gorgeous – with mistletoe and shawls
And candles flickered frescoes, around the airy walls
The women folk looked lovely – the boys looked kinda treed
Till the leader got to yelling: ""Hey, fellers, let's stampede!""
And the music started sighing, and availing through the hall
As a kind of introduction to ""The Cowboys Christmas Ball""

Their leader was a feller that came from Swenson's ranch
They called him ""Windy Billy,"" from ""little Dead man's Branch""
His rig was ""kinda careless,"" big spurs and high-heeled boots
He had the reputation that come when ""a fellers shoots""
His voice was like a bugle upon a mountainous height
His feet were animated an' a mighty, moving sight
When he commenced to hollering, ""Now, fellers stake your pen!""
""Lock horns with all them heifers, and Russel them like men
""Salute yer lovely critters; now swing and let them go
""Climb the grape vine around them — all hands do-ce-do!
""You Mavericks, join the round-up – Just skip her waterfall""
Huh! It was getting happy, The Cowboys Christmas Ball

Don't tell me about cotillions, or Germans, no sirree!
That whirl at Carson City just takes the cake with me
I'm sick of lazy shuffling's, of them I've had my fill
Just Give me a frontier break-down, backed up by Wild Old Bill

Mc Allister isn't nowhere, when Windy leads the show
I've seen them both in harness, and so I sorta know
Oh, Bill, I shall not forget you, and I'll oftentimes recall
That lively gaited soiree — ""The Cowboys Christmas Ball""

Oh, Bill, I shall not forget you, and I'll oftentimes recall

Warm beachfront palm December afternoon
You close your eyes
Another year blows by
Somewhere in the wind
Just another life

My parents sent a Christmas card and tennis shoes
""We understand you're staying
And we're proud of you""
There's a well-rehearsed disinterest in the atmosphere
I don't know if that's what this town gave me
Or if it led me here

And I played so many parts
I don't know which one's really me
Don't know if I can take

Another Christmas in L.A
Another pitcher of Sangria
In an empty beach café
Another Christmas in L.A
Hold me tighter Carmelita
I don't know how long I can stay

Left a girl behind in my old man's truck
Sometimes I wonder where she ended up
Maybe she got married, had a couple of kids
Who do you think you're fooling man?
Of course she did

I'm walking in Dan Tana's bar
Try and talk with Harry Dean
I don't know if I can take

Another Christmas in L.A
Another casting call on Thursday
For a job that doesn't pay
Another Christmas in L.A
Another burnout in a tank top
Who seems to bask in his decay
A fat protagonist in flip flops
With an extensive resume
From Echo Park to Catalina

Dreaming of a white Christmas
The one I used to know
Tree tops glisten, children listen
To sleigh bells in the snow"

Up in the old North Pole
There lived a lump of anthracite
Whose parents called him Joel

Joel, Joel, the lump of coal
Happy as a lump can be
He just wants to keep Santa warm
And make the elves cozy

But Santa Claus had other plans
For Joel one fateful day
""Joel, you're just the lump I need
Come join me on my sleigh""

Joel, Joel, the lump of coal
Heart leapt up with joy
""I'll soon be Santa's present to
A lucky girl or boy

We'll laugh and play together
And we'll hold each other tight
Snuggle under clean white sheets
When we go to sleep at night""

Then Santa's elves all laughed at Joel
""You're in for a surprise
You're not a special Christmas gift
You're just a booby prize

What kid would ever want you?
You're filthy as can be
Now you have to go and live
With one who's been naughty""

""But I make heat,"" poor Joel cried
""And electricity""
""You pollute the air
With CO2 and mercury""

Joel, Joel, the lump of coal
Fell down upon his knees
""I don't wanna live with a naughty kid
Don't make me, Santa, please""

But Santa laughed his jolly laugh
""Ho, ho, you stupid lump
You're just the thing to teach this brat
That Santa ain't no chump""

So off they flew and, before he knew
Joel was in a sack
He cried and yelled to Santa Claus
""Why don't we just go back?""

And then came Christmas morning
And, much to Joel's surprise (Much to Joel's surprise)
He saw a boy with the saddest face
And tears were in his eyes (Tears were in his eyes)

He picked Joel up and held him
And said ""You can be my friend (Hey man, let's be friends)
I would've liked some presents but
You're what Santa chose to send (Santa chose to send)

It's true, I've been a naughty boy
And maybe that's a sin (Maybe that's a sin)
If this is how Santa treats the kids
I'm just glad that I'm not him""

Joel, Joel, the lump of coal
Knew what he must do
He said ""Now I know the reason why
I got sent to you

Cause when a person hurts inside
It turns him hard and cruel
But I know how to make your pain
Into a precious jewel

So take me in your hand, young man
And squeeze with all your might
Let's turn your pain and anger
Into something that shines bright""

Then Joel, Joel, the lump of coal
He gave his life away
So that one good naughty little boy
Had a diamond on Christmas day"

I'm getting tired
Of all this
Running around

And we know it wasn't easy
You've been after me a long while
A pathological display
Now take a moment to imagine
My dismay
When I heard you had a heart change
I was skeptical at first
'Til you've seen it for yourself
I guess you just expect the worst

Crooked nose and bloodshot eyes
Iron will for telling lies
Cheap sick smile and one inch fuse
You hurt me Santa and I'm confused

Pretty girls, Christmas lights
Mistletoe, holy nights
Don't it sound like heaven on a cloud?

Yeah, I hear you on the bomb shell
I was taken back myself
And I'd like to make it alright
So I called the elves
We hashed up a little guess what
Your nice status was renewed
Just tell Santa what you want
I'm gonna make your dreams come true

Red Porsche 944 like Jake
In ""Sixteen Candles"" for goodness sake
And a couple more you might have missed
Like a shiny Rolex on my wrist and

Pretty girls, Christmas lights
Mistletoe, holy nights
Don't it sound like heaven on a cloud?

Too many people in black robes posing as judges
They should turn that mirror around
Too many people weighed down by frivolous grudges
When will we look to leave the past behind?

You know it's nice to see you wrapped up
See how far you've come
There's something to be said for being present
Not just getting one
So pass the gravy and tap your toes
And don't mind Ol' Jack Frost nipping at your nose

A crooked nose and bloodshot eyes
Iron will for telling lies
If you've got squabble in your skin
Just take that turkey and trade it in for

Pretty girls, Christmas lights
Mistletoe, holy nights

All I ever really wanted was
Pretty girls, Christmas lights
Mistletoe, holy nights
Don't it sound like heaven on a cloud?
Don't it sound like heaven on a cloud?"

The small, dusty sidecar of Las Vegas. Henderson was just like any other town in America, only with slot machines in the laundromat. It was 1990, and Vegas was boomin', baby! But Jeanie and Terry weren't gamblers or dealers or mafiosos or lounge singers. They were just two normal people trying to keep up with the pack in a one-hundred-and-sixteen-degree rat race. And those rats; they'd nibbled long enough. Now, I don't know what a mosey looks like, but they packed up their house and their clothes and their me, and they moseyed on outta dodge. Of course, I had my gripes about leavin'. I mean, I had a life in Henderson. Kenny and Kevin Hebner were just two houses up. The desert fort behind my house wasn't gonna defend itself. But what could I do? I was nine. A nine-year-old can't just stage a sit-in while the rest of the family checks out. This wasn't a Home Alone movie, so... I went where the sweet'n'sour chicken was cooked, and the ice-cold, caffeine-free Coke was just a fridge away. And just like that, from sagebrush, slot machines and Elvis to Footloose, Onion Days and Jewel. She was born there, after all. This place called Payson, Utah. God's country. Population: blink, and you'll miss it. Dad got a job in the produce department at the Smith's Food King, which was fitting since he managed to produce six kids: April, Shelley, Amy, Stephanie and my brother Shane were the other five. I was in fourth grade at the time, an age when boys start thinking more like men. And there wasn't a dull moment: I'd had my first fight, my first crush, my first rodeo, but most importantly my first white Christmas. I did my best to fit in, and I did as my teachers said, but that year one teacher stood out from the rest. He didn't just stand out from the rest; he sung out. His name was Mr. Hansen. And on a frosty December morning, he explained to us the story of the old standard ""I'll Be Home For Christmas"". A tale of a World War II soldier stationed overseas, writing a letter to his family about the return that he may never make. I saw it struck deep in him. Now, it would be easy to describe Mr. Hansen as brave. After all, this was a man who himself had served his country during the Korean war. But getting up in front of twenty five nine-year-olds and singing a cappella? That's a whole other kind of bravery altogether. The other kids were looking for the nearest escape: they couldn't bear the embarrassment. But not me. I was wrapped up in it. I couldn't help myself. I knew I was experiencing something different from the others, but I was uplifted so it didn't matter. I felt the isolation of war. I felt the power of a song, and that's the kind of thing that sticks with you. You don't let it go. And so, for this here Christmas song, I have a friend I brought along. He's eighty six, but sounds like twenty, and though the other kids might find it funny, he'd like to sing his song for you, and if he doesn't mind I might join in too.""

I'll be home for Christmas
You can count on me
Please have snow and mistletoe
And presents on the tree

Oh Christmas eve will find me
Where the love light gleams
I'll be home for Christmas
If only in my dreams

I'll be home for Christmas
You can count on me
Please have snow and mistletoe
And presents on the tree

Oh Christmas eve will find me
Where the love light gleams
I'll be home for Christmas
If only in my dreams

I don't know what happened, I'm out on my feet
I hear my mother calling my name
I still come running, but I ain't the same

You can change the channel
Take the phone off the hook
Avoid the headlines
But you'll never grow up, baby, if you don't look

When I saw him go down
Felt like somebody lied
I had to hold my breath 'til the coast was clear
When I saw him go down
Felt like somebody lied
I had to close my eyes just to stop the tears

You're used to winning, how did it feel?
Could you hear the screaming? It was unreal
What did they pay you, what did it cost?
How long did it take you to know that you lost?

You can hit the showers
Fill the place up with steam
Close the curtains
But when you woke up, man it wasn't no dream

When I saw him go down
Felt like somebody lied
I had to hold my breath 'til the coast was clear
When I saw him go down
Felt like somebody lied
I had to close my eyes, close my eyes
Just to stop the tears

Lookin' out the window out on the street
My boy and his mother
And I think of me
Feelin' the slip again
Don't wanna fall
You said it was nothing, but maybe you're wrong

'Cause when I saw him go down
Felt like somebody lied
I had to hold my breath 'til the coast was clear
When I saw him go down
Felt like somebody lied
I had to close my eyes just to stop the tears

But when Jesus heard that, he said unto them, ""They that be whole need not a physician, but they that are sick.""

I walked into town with a message for my old man
I've got the last two chapters of Matthew in my hand
Steve painting houses while Bobby went and gone insane
They buried my sister but daddy he stayed the same

You wanna be sure, I'll give you sight
Brother, just lean into the light

His hands still shake when the ponies break out on the track
(Here comes the calling)
His feet still quick when they say they want their money back (Here comes the calling)
But Daddy did you think that you could outrun the Holy Ghost? (Here comes the calling)
Lie, cheat, steal, hope they fix it all up in post

The book will be open
In front of the judge
Unquenchable fire
Or keys to the kingdom

Follow the sun out of the night

(Just lean into the light)
You wanna be sure, I'll give you sight
Brother, just lean into the light

The road to the kingdom's burnin' bright
Brother, just lean into the light

You heard that the master was traveling through
But what would you do if he walked in the room?
Make for the left, or break for the right?
Brother, just lean in
Brother, just lean into the light

Follow the sun out of the night

We both know where this is leading
You love to walk away
You love to walk away

All night, all night waiting for you
Three flights, dehydrated and
Send cars - they all keep waiting for you
All night baby
All night

You said we should go get coffee
Tell me you don't need nobody
Heard it before - photocopy
You're so sad, so what, we're all sad

Sweet thing
I hope that you find that feeling
How come you're always leaving?
You love to walk away
How are you sleeping?
It don't looking like you've been eating
We both know where this is leading
You love to walk away

How are you sleeping?

I was never gonna leave you there, yeah
With your mother and a child that I didn't wanna know
We were bleeding out our beautiful noses
We were bleeding on our beautiful clothes
We were weaving in and out of Edgar Allan Poe, oh-oh-oh

Somewhere, someone must have been watching
Hey there, I wish somebody was watching us

I know the night has got two faces
There's one that runs and one that chases
But if it caught you in between
Then I would wait for you in dreams
Right at the edges of your answers
Somewhere underneath your laughter
And if you wanna know what it all means
Then I am here for you in dreams

I was always gonna be your ending
I was always gonna meet you there, yeah
At the centre of attention right before close
I was managing your expectations
On a pick-up full of pink carnations
You were begging me to cure the sickness of a rose, oh-oh-oh

Somewhere, someone must have been watching
Hey there, do you wish somebody was watching us?

I know the night has got two faces
There's one that runs and one that chases
But if it caught you in between
Then I would wait for you in dreams
Right at the edges of your answers
Somewhere underneath your laughter
And if you wanna know what it all means
Then I am here for you in dreams

Feels like it was a lifetime
I got in your head
Ran my fingers through all your anger
Wrapped around like an anchor
Held us by a thread

And I know it's not your fault, gave it everything you had
Can you see it's not my fault from where you're at?

Baby, don't forget when you're famous
Love's anonymous, faceless
So show yourself to me
And come on back for me
Waiting at the end of the century
I can't sleep with a memory
So show yourself to me
And come on back for me

First kiss drawing blood like it's lipstick
Using it like a mystic
Tell me who you've been
My arms start to look like a crossroads
We're the only ones lost though
Buried in between

But I know it's not your fault, there was only one way out
Can you see it's not my fault from where you're at?

Baby, don't forget when you're famous
Love's anonymous, faceless
So show yourself to me
And come on back for me
Waiting at the end of the century
I can't sleep with a memory
So show yourself to me
And come on back for me

Come on back for me
Come on back for me

Baby, don't forget when you're famous
Love's anonymous, faceless

Over there in the arms of somebody
Is all your dreaming about
Standing next to me
We were young and amused
Now we're dancing to a tune
We can't be who we used to be
Dublin in ecstasy

We got high from time to time
I recalled the shiver
Running down my spine
I can see the city in the glass of your eye
And when you take your shot
I'll be there this time
This time

Where the arc lights
Used to dampen and die
We were never thinking much
Only sometimes

We got high from time to time
I recalled the shiver
Running down my spine
I can see the city in the glass of your eye
And when you take your shot
I'll be there this time
Dublin in ecstasy

I only want to speak if you have the time
I only wanna fight if it's for your life
I only wanna speak if you have the time
Not just a friend of a friend of mine

Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh

Where I first met you
I'm saying hello
But I don't wanna forget
We let the summer burn
Through the month of November
We used to fly so high
From what I remember

You can try
But I won't care
We can drive for miles
But only she can get me there
And all your signs
I'm glad they don't lead me anywhere
I don't wanna burn out, baby
So why can't I stay a while
When I have her on my mind
On my mind

Time goes by
Still it won't move me
And the words I should have found
Came to me too slowly
You're trying your best
To please somebody
No one said it would be hard
But goodbyes are never easy

You can try
But I won't care
We can drive for miles
But only she can get me there
And all your signs
I'm glad they don't lead me anywhere
I don't wanna burn out, baby
So why can't I stay a while
When I have her on my mind
On my mind

You say you never saw it coming
But you ain't got that thing she has
I know enough about it
Take me as I am
Or leave here fast
I don't wanna hear about it
Got the wrong place
At the right time
You know why, but you can't win
Yeah, you know
She's on my mind
All the time

Yeah, you know
When I have her on my mind
Yeah, you know
When I have her on my mind

Until the wind blows me through

I'll still give myself to you

On our knees

I still don't know why
I do the things

You say it's meaningless
To look the other way
I'm begging for a hand
To get me out of this place
Because I'll take this Armageddon
To the grave
So can we fix this love of ours?
It's getting late
I can't see straight

You say a lot of things

In the city we tried
Shining East of your face
Thought you'd aim at her gates

Walking around under neon lights
Find me a lover if the money's right

Showing it off to the cruisers eyes

Dreaming of days of a different life

And some of them want me in their cars
When they take me I close my eyes
Imagine you living the desert life

""That's definitely not what he said""

Yeah, the gapped tooth and the years of denial
Do you have something else that you'd like to say?
""Well, actually, yes, when I was a kid I was obsessed with science
And saw so many random acts of va-va-va-va-violence
The method of the madness made me think I like it
The science of silence, the silence of violence""
So what came first, the silence or violence?
""Oh hunny, you know it really depends on what you're buying these days""

All of my friends call me a light sleeper
Well, I guess that I just don't dream anymore
I used to call the shots but sometimes the shots just have to call themselves
Like making a U-turn on the belt of the highway, I can do it my way now

Like turning around to the burning building
I threw it away for the better living
One at a time and I stepped right in
The carnal knowledge embraced my skin
The smoke from the halls sank in my nose, my eyes, my soul, my shit, my grin
I screamed for my life, I screamed, I screamed, ""Help me""
No one can hear you in the walls of sin
Concrete floors that I love living in
One last breath before I give in
Just one last breath before it's Christmas morning
The bells are out and I'm in mourning
Wish I had a sign, wish I had a warning
That the bells of Heaven would come and erase my nose, my eyes, my sin, my face
On New Years Eve
The years behind are just another reason to lead
All the beautiful lives we lead
When fear is all we need

What a beautiful life

And it's coming from the back row, side row, never-even-tried row
Nice man if you knew him well
I heard he owned a place called the Liberty Belle, yeah

Well, is it easy?

Me shoes had brought the rain and soaked the space for lookin' down
As drunk as love is lethal, I spun a lady 'round
And I kissed her 'neath the waking of a Dublin City sky

She threw her shoes into her bag and danced just like a dream
Her face was rubied up just like no sun I'd ever seen
She said I was a phony, I said I could be mean
And I treated her so badly I made my baby cry

The January markets filled the cold air with the sound
The boys all full of laughter and their pocket with the pound
And in the foggy dew, I saw you throwing shapes around
It was underneath the waking of a Dublin City sky

And it all makes sour
To watch my lover wrap her arms around the flag of power
Hurry now you will
To know you is to love you and I love you even still
But we'll never truly be
We trip along disaster in the whirlwind of the free
Altogether now

Threw himself before a bullet

The sailors were drinking American wine
And I wished I could go back to spring again

That's life moving on
Some stayed behind to get drunk on the song
And they wish they could go back to spring again
Oh, such a spring
Oh, such a spring
Oh, such a spring

The noise of the town
The salt in the air
It plays all around but I no longer care
And I wish I could go back to spring again

And down through the years
It all turns to tears

Just to die

Kissed and ran
Licked away

Been and done
One for all

That your shoulders are frozen (cold as the night)
Oh, but you're an explosion (you're dynamite)
Your name isn't Rio, but I don't care for sand
And lighting a fuse might result in a bang, b-b-bang-go

I bet that you look good on the dance floor
I don't know if you're looking for romance or...
I don't know what you're looking for
I said I bet that you look good on the dance floor
Dancing to electro-pop like a robot from 1984
Well, from 1984!

And no, there ain't no love, no Montagues or Capulets
Just banging tunes and DJ sets
Dirty dance floors, and dreams of naughtiness!

And I bet the Juliet was just the icing on the cake
Make no mistake, no

And even if somehow we could have shown you the place you wanted
Well, I'm sure you could have made it that bit better on your own

And I bet she told a million people that she'd stay in touch
But all the little promises they don't mean much
When there's memories to be made
And I hope you're holding hands by new year's eve

There was tears on the steering wheel dripping on the seat,
Several hours or several weeks,
I'd have the cheek to say they're equally as bleak!

It's the beginning of the end, the car went up the hill,
And disappeared around the bend, ask anyone they'll tell you that.
It's these times that it tends,
The start to breaking up, to start to fall apart
Oh! hold on to your heart.

Do me a favour and break my nose!
Do me a favour and tell me to go away!
Do me a favour and stop asking questions!

She walked away, well her shoes were untied,
And the eyes were all red,
You could see that we'd cried, and I watched and I waited,
'Till she was inside, forcing a smile and waving goodbye.

Curiousity becomes a heavy load,
Too heavy to hold, too heavy to hold.
Curiousity becomes a heavy load,
Too heavy to hold, will force you to be cold.

And do me a favour, and ask if you need some help!
She said, do me a favour and stop flattering yourself!
How to tear apart the ties that bind, perhaps 'fuck off' might be too kind,
Perhaps 'fuck off' might be too kind"

The more you're forcing performance
And all the attention is leading me to feel important (completely obnoxious)

Wriggling around and it's so that you won't forget

Aimlessly gazing at the faces in the queue
Struggling with the notion that it's life not film

He's not the jealous type
And I only need to get half an excuse and I'm away

That the tragedy is true
And I knew 'how could she could have anyone she wants
And I'm struggling to think of an immediate response

Like I don't mind
Be a big mistake
For you to wait
And let me waste your time
Really love it's fine
Really love it's fine

And then the first time it occurred that there was something to destroy

And offered me your attention in the form of a gobstopper

And I loved that little game you had called ""Crying Lightning""

It was on its way to meet you
Thinking of excuses to postpone
You never looked like yourself from the side
But your profile could not hide
The fact you knew I was approaching your throne

With folded arms you occupied the bench like toothache
Stood and puffed your chest out like you'd never lost a war
And though I tried so not to suffer the indignity of a reaction
There was no cracks to grasp or gaps to claw

And your past times consisted of the strange

As a miserable little tyke
At least that's the conclusion
She came to in this overture

Not looking like she was soon to leave
I had to squint in order to believe
And then like a butler pushing on a bookshelf
And unveiling the unexpected
I, who was earlier reluctant, was suddenly embarrassed and corrected
How could such a creature
Survive in such a habitat

In the eye of the storm
She flicks a red hot revelation
Off the tip of her tongue
It does a dozen somersaults
And leaves you supercharged
Makes me wanna blow the candles out
Just to see if you glow in the dark

Shalalala
Shalalala
Shalalala
Shalalala

Home sweet home
Home sweet home
Home sweet booby trap
I took the batteries out my mysticism
And put them in my thinking cap
She's got a telescopic hallelujah
Hanging up on the wall
For when it gets too complicated
In the eye of the storm

Shalalala
Shalalala
Shalalala
Shalalala

And in a Hellcat-spangled cavern
When your judgment's on the run
And you're acting like a stranger
'Cause you thought it looked like fun
And did you ever get the feeling
That these are things she's said before
Her steady hands may well have done
The Devil's pedicure
What you waiting for
Sing another fucking shalalala

On bonfire night
Fill in a circular hole with a peg that's square

On gloomy afternoons
Tinting the solitude
Put on your dancing shoes
And show me what to do

High noon has changed its tune
Linking arms, sinking hearts

And sorrow slow dances
Around the edges of her eyes

When she laughs, the heavens hum a stun-gun lullaby
Those twinkling vixens with the shining spiral eyes
Their hypnosis goes unnoticed when she's walking by

At the Heartbreak Hotel
And sat in the back booth
By the pamphlets and the literature
On how to lose
Your waitress was miserable
And so was your food

Make sure you wear your comfortable shoes

Mysteries flashing amber
Go green when you answer
But the red on the rest of the questionnaire
Never changes

To shoot me out of a cannon

I've tried to ask you this in some daydreams that I've had
But you're always busy being make believe

And do you look into the mirror to remind yourself you're there
Or have somebody's goodnight kisses got that covered?
When I'm not being honest I pretend that you were just some lover

Now I can't think of there without thinking of you
I doubt that comes as a surprise
And I can't think of anything to dream about
I can't find anywhere to hide
And when I'm hanging on by the rings around my eyes
And I convince myself I need another
For a minute it gets easier to pretend that you were just some lover

Singing dreadful songs about summer

His Holy Ghost stories and bloodshed never scared me none
While they bowed their heads on Sunday
I cut out through the hedges and fields
Where the light could place its hands on my head
In the west hills

Free in the west hills
Free in the west hills

She's got two full-grown children, one still on the vine
And once I got to know him I loved him like he was mine
Some nights we drive up the mouth of the canyon
On hillbilly heroin pills
We get out and watch the sunset
Peaceful and still

And free in the west hills
Free in the west hills

When the sheriff kicked my door down
I was sleeping in my own bed
And the mess I got caught up in
Rained hard down on my head
They got me for possession of them hillbilly heroin pills
Enough to kill the horses that run free in the west hills
They got me for possession of enough to kill the horses that run

Free in the west hills

If this life was meant for proving
I could use more years to live
But fifteen in a guardhouse
That's more than I'm willing to give
And if there really is a judgement
When He pulls my chart
He'll reject my actions
But He will know my heart
And he'll prepare a place for me
Where happiness instills
And the light puts its loving hands on my head
Free in the west hills
They got me for possession of enough to kill the horses that run

Free in the west hills

Free, free in the west hills, in the west hills, in the west hills"

Carrying sheet metal and household appliances through the pouring rain
They were planning on getting married after graduation
Had a little baby girl, trouble came and shut it down
Things like that ain't supposed to happen

In this quiet town, families are tight
Good people, they still don't deadbolt their doors at night
In this quiet town

When we first heard opioid stories, they were always in whispering tones
Now banners of sorrow mark the front steps of childhood homes
Parents wept through daddy's girl eulogies
And merit badge milestones with their daughters and sons
Laying there lifeless in their suits and gowns
Somebody's been keepin' secrets

In this quiet town, they know how to live
Good people who lean on Jesus, they're quick to forgive
In this quiet town

Now whenever I'm near the town I'll find some reason to give
And I will walk with the dead and the living where I used to live
And every time I see my parents in the prime of their lives
Offering their son the kind of love he could never put down
Well, part of me is still that stainless kid, lucky

In this quiet town, salt of the land
Hard-working people, if you're in trouble, they'll lend you a hand
Here in this quiet town

School let out and the sun beats down
Smoke billows from a Sunday train
That cries away from a quiet town"

Around here, we all take up our cross and hang on His holy name, But the cards that I was dealt will get you thrown out of the game
Hey momma, can't you see your boy is wrapped up in the strangle silk
Of this cobweb town where culture is king?

I close my eyes and think of the water
Out at the Salt Creek when I was young

Down at Old Mill Park, half the town's in tow
To crown the Bathing Beauty of the rodeo
While her mother fights back proud tears a young cowboy gives the nod
The chute opens, bull draws blood, and the gift is accepted by God

Whiskey from a plastic jug

And we picked you wildflowers
You gotta open your eyes

Hey, dreamcatcher, come out and see the leaves
The mountainside's all watermelon red
Soon enough, they're gonna rust and fall
Leave the mountainside cold and bare
But when the longer days of sun appear
They'll be rising like an answered prayer and I know that

Everyone is afraid of losing
Even the ones that always win
Hey sleepwalker, when the mountain comes back to life
It doesn't come from without
It comes from within

The hills are barren, but we look for what's to come:
Sweeter skies and longer days of sun
When you wake up, I'll be standing in the line
To kiss your eyes and wipe the tears from mine

Hey, sleepwalker, Western Bluebells and Painted Cups are getting ready to rise
It's time to begin
It doesn't come from without

And this horse come out
And everyone, you know, said it was supposed to be the best
And it fell in the mud and
Mean, you could see its leg just totally snapped
It was just hanging there
And the girl, you know, laid do-
It was the saddest thing, I mean
I think most of the crowd was crying
She sat up and laid over her horse
And just cried and hugged her horse
And, 'cause she knew that
You know, that was her last moments with that horse

Coca-Cola grin, honeysuckle skin
Born beneath the ruddy sign of a strawberry moon

Shows up for her friends, crazy 'bout the bends

We had spring in our heels
Unwavering forces
Head first into the unknown

Like runaway horses
In a fever till the end
And every step is a silver prayer
In the face of a hard wind

You traded school
For wedding rings and rent, invitations sent
Of you and him by a barn out on the edge of town
Small town girl
Put your dreams on ice, never thinking twice
Some you'll surely forget and some that you never will

There was a promise in our stride
But we changed courses
Head first into the unknown

And every step is a silver prayer
In the face of a hard wind

It's a long way back home again
When every step is a silver prayer

I put this film on the windows, and it looks like chapel glass
But when she turns, it's like the shadow of the cross don't cast
No blessing over our lonely life
It's like waiting for a train to pass, and I don't know when it'll pass

But I remember when she used to set the room on fire
With her eyes, swear to God
It's like a flood of grief and sorrow from a haunted life
When she cries, like a train, it's a lot

I dropped a line to a flickering high school flame
We laughed about all the ways that our lives had changed
She's up the road, about 35 miles north
Got two little boys in school, just had a real bad divorce
And in a moment of weakness

I told her if she ever needed a helping hand
I would lend, swear to God

Of children in the grass running through the sprinklers?
Being somebody's wife?
Or were you living in another life?

When will I make it home?
When I damn well feel like driving
Down these empty streets
That burn though our birthright

I passed a couple of kids holding hands in the street tonight
They reminded me of us in another life
Am I the man of your desire?
Or just a guy from your hometown?
Are these the arms that you saw when you
Pictured yourself wrapped around?
Baby, I can vouch for the hopeless dreamer
When you look at me, am I the man you hoped I'd be?

When will I make it home?
When that jukebox in the corner
Stops playing country songs of stories that sound like mine

I spent my best years laying rubber on a factory line
I wonder what I would've been in another life
In another life
In another life

And memories of Happy Meals

And think about how small we are
Sweating it out in the pressure machine
Good till the last drop

Why don't you say little things?
Butterflies don't just dance on a string
It feels like you clipped all their wings
And every year goes by faster than the one before

What's written in the heavens above
Can't be denied, it's bigger than love

The streets are dripping with decisions of a quiet kind
Hallucinations on the shoulder of the borderline
With my experience, I'm better off just backing down
Instead of tripping through the pages of your side of town

Serrated edges of the blade are scraping over the leather
I guess we couldn't keep it together
I thought we had it covered forever

I'm hanging on your side of town
I notice when you're not around
Can't keep my cool, I'm burning inside
A broken heartbeat, barely alive

And it's harder to breathe
'Cause I couldn't make you believe
What's written in the heavens above
Can't be denied, it's getting harder to breathe
'Cause I couldn't make you believe
What's written in the heavens above
Can't be denied, it's
Bigger than love"

With empty hands
I still know how to use 'em but the miles made other plans
Running out of highway
Shorter on time
Feel the dead weight deepen and the devil comin' down the line

The dashboard shaking
I steady the wheel
And I make every turn by memory, by feel
Towards a black horizon
An unbroken dawn
Will this endless stretch of desert road get me back where I belong?

Will you turn the bright lights on?
Baby, turn the bright lights on
'Cause I haven't forgotten where it is I'm from
Look out your window for me, here I come
Will you turn the bright lights on?
Baby, turn the bright lights on
Put me back on the corner to sing my song
I'm a shoo-in tonight, turn the bright lights on

I carried my own weight
And then some too
There are things I would change, but it ain't worth going through
Maybe I'm tapped out
Or just plain old tired
Tonight the charge is reading low, but I'm still hard-wired

Your body followed this feeling like following light
Once that your music was born it followed you 'round
And then it gave your activities meaning and let you be loud

You're sad but you smile, it's not in your eyes
Your eyeballs don't change, it's the muscles around your eyes

An egg to fertilize, a pulse to stabilize
A body to deodorize, a life to scrutinize
A child to criticize, young adults to modernize
Citizens to terrorize, generations to desensitize

Your dreams are sweet and obsessed and you're overworked
You're over taken by visions of being overlooked
How disappointed would D.I.D.I.P.P. be
To see such power in our hands all wasted on greed?
Am I a prisoner to instincts or do my thoughts just live as free
And detached as boats to the dock?

Just like the music was born and detached from your heart
Is your free time to free minds or for falling apart?
Night after night you turn off the light
You don't fall asleep, right away, are we, are we done?

A desk to organize, a product to advertise
A market to monopolize, movie stars to idolize
Leaders to scandalize, enemies to neutralize
No time to apologize, fury to tranquilize
Weapons to synchronize, cities to vapor-i(ze)"

Twenty-three years of the same
And I'm sorry 'bout this morning
For the damage I will pay

All the mirrors face the walls and
I wake just to long for bed
Love what's got you so down low?
The saddest tongue is in your head

I forget the thrill of lies
The truth escaping through the eyes, now
You use voices on the phone
That once were spent on me

The world has changed beyond our doorstep
People talk and dress so strange
I don't know a neighbour's name
And all of life is rearranged

Nice to know that you're still caring
Well enough to raise your voice
But if we must bring up the past then
Please don't speak to me of choice

Across the way moved in a pair
With passion in its prime
Maybe they look through to us
And hope that's them in time"

Are you lying through your teeth or are they paying through your nose?

I seen you sticking to your smile, it's gone and broken my heart
Now the wind is making work of every step on the bridge
You say, ""I used to say we found each other, now I don't know
Where he is""

You get that feel, make your spirit shine
I let her prise apart my ribcage like a crackhead at the blinds
It hurt
But come the downing of the scrapyard sun
There is no light falls on our failure
It ain't covered in the paper

Well I really don't care what you think of me
But something gears me to the grovel every opportunity
I've got that jealous stripe
I probably am that type
I'll see you twenty Marys later
When your tongue is talking straighter

Heard he took 'em all down to the mercenary bar
I heard she broke up with her fella now he's drinkin' in his car
Nah
I'm not inclined towards the scandalous word
But on the subject of myself I do believe what I've heard

There is a track beneath the wheel and it's there till we die
She says, ""I don't agree with nothing"" I say, ""Neither do I""
Go to sleep
There's not a thing can't be fixed with a dream
And we can talk about it later

And if there was sunshine, it was never on me
So close the rain, so pronounced is the pain

It was a clamber of a life I sucked the ring off every hand
Had 'em plying me with drink, even met with their demands
When the cherries lined up I kept the spoilings for myself
Till I had 30 ways of dying looking at me from the shelf
A cloud-parting smile I had, a real good child I was
But this island's run by sharks with children's bones stuck in their jaws
Now the morning's filled with cokeys tryna talk you through it all
Is their mammy Fine Gael and is their daddy Fianna Fáil?
And they say they love the land but they don't feel it go to waste
Put a mirror to the youth and they will only see their face
Makes flowers read like broadsheets, ""every young man wants to die""
Say it to the man who profits and the bastard walks by
And the bastard walks by, and the passer walks by
Say it to him fifty times and still the bastard won't cry
Would I lie?

It was a clamber of a life, I sucked the ring off every hand

And I loved ye like a penny loves the pocket of a priest
And I'll love you till the grass around my gravestone is deceased
And I'm heading for the cokeys, I will tell them 'bout it all
About the gall of Fine Gael and the fail of Fianna Fáil
And now the flowers read like broadsheets, every young man wants to die

While always stays for none

It's evening for you, and another bare hotel room
So hard to believe, that you're dreaming of me too
But it's true

You only go around, round, round
You only go around, round, round
You only go around, round, round
You only go around, round, round

And Amsterdam, I never knew you so well
The stadium rings with laughter, at every turn
At flying piano's of all things, to set your scene
I'm such a nice man to you, but so obscene
And it's true girl

You only go around, round, round
You only go around, round, round
You only go around, round, round
You only go around, round, round

Jackie big tits, is hiding in the corner
Respect is the word she shouts, as I implore her
Speaks her mind not me, for I was only speaking freely
Interupt me once more, I'll take you to the cleaners

You can't push me around, round, round
You can't push me around, round, round
You only go around, round, round
You only go around, round, round

You carry on, I'll marry you,
But why is it taking so long?

But oh honey please, don't shed no tears,
As long as I'm here,
But oh honey please, don't shed no tears,
As long as I'm here."

So hard to leave you all alone
We get so drunk that we can hardly see
What use to that to you or me, baby?
See I notice nothing makes you shatter, no, no
You're a lover of the wild and a joker of the heart
But are you mine?

I wanna make you happy
I wanna make you feel alive
Let me make you happy
I wanna make you feel alive at night
I wanna make you happy
If you're a good girl tonight

We sink to be sunk, but life is no race
When I'm not happy I'm in disgrace
So I spend time with guessing on you
You're a lover of the wild and a joker of the heart
But are you mine?

I wanna make you happy
I wanna make you feel alive
Let me make you happy
I wanna make you feel alive at night
I wanna make you happy
If you're a good girl tonight

Still I notice nothing makes you shatter no, no
You're a lover of the wild and a joker of the heart
But are you mine?

I wanna make you happy
I wanna make you feel alive
Let me make you happy
I wanna make you feel alive at night
I wanna make you happy
If you're a good girl tonight"

Only in my head
Slipping in and out of time

Always higher

They were singing

How'd you like that?
How'd you like that?
How'd you like that?
I like it

How'd you like that?
How'd you like that?
How'd you like that?
It lifts me up

What better time to
Take a ride with you
Through the universe tonight

The look of silence
Much like your face
And the symphony that helps me sing

They were singing,
How'd you like that?
How'd you like that?
How'd you like that?

How'd you like that?
How'd you like that?
How'd you like that?
I liked it

I feel for what you feel for me
Let's work together

How'd you like that?
How'd you like that?)
Take it out across the sea
To America

Wash my hands and shake my feet
And yes I missed you all
Since I last saw you I fell down the rabbit hole

As I wonder what we'd be like
Wrapped up, so up tight with you
Lust will do funny things
I don't want you to go out looking so good
And you look so good

Rosie,
Well I feel your love and I want you to agree
To be,
Still take your time but get to me
Rosie

She looked away as I mentioned my name
The street lights light up my shame
The world can take you and swallow you whole
But you're a big girl and I think you already know
You've been bought and sold

Be careful with me
I see all that you see
Troy died in a day for little Rosie

Rosie,
Well I feel your love and I want you to agree
To be,
Still take your time roll your stone to me
Rosie

Gonna find you now I'll walk the beat
And you'll do me a pirouette in the street
And although we'll fall we'll find our feet

Well I wanted you so easily
Illusions past and now I see
Image is so different to reality

Exquisite visions fill up my mind
Do you remember me?
Taking pictures of you as the light came through
You were running away
And I asked you for a place to stay
Do you remember me, taking pictures of you
Taking pictures of you

Now, I have a secret I need to tell you
I have been true, and I needed no clue

A thousand people knocking on his door

Well that could take me anywhere

That day you seemed to change
We all need someone to guide us
Someone to introduce the show
I needed someone just like you
Someone to let me know
I could lose it all

Well I began to breakdown
Searching overtime
Bring me a pig's heart
And a glass of wine
There was nothing that you could've done
There was nothing that you should've said
We're both still chasing shadows in our heads
It was all too soon

But is it me, is it you
Is it the times that we're going through
Was it hard, did your heart breakdown
Is your mind still in control
There is a violence in love
Some things I'll never understand
So where the bullets missed you out
They hit me and I'm falling down again

Well I began to breakdown
Searching overtime
Bring me a pig's heart
And a glass of wine
There was nothing that you could've done
There was nothing that you should've said
I'm still chasing shadows in my head

Was it me, was it you

Yeah, the things that you can do
That no one else can do to me at all

Am I wasting my time?
As I feel that I'll go out
And find someone that's out of luck too

And if I had to do it all again
I were to feel the love that I know you can send
Did I send love?
Did I move too close?
Will the wind blow her away?
Will the wind blow her away?

And I saw you cry
So I know you didn't mean
To creep into my dreams just to turn me down

You say you feel so used
But it was you who turned it on
And used all of your charms just to bring me in

And everybody knows the games she plays
And every time she loses she runs away
Did I send love?
Did I move too close?
Will the wind blow her away?
Where will the wind blow her today?
Will the wind blow her away?

You can help me out
I want to love you again
You can help me out
I want to love you again

And you're the one I can't run from

Went up against the system,
Oh oh, I don't know

Who are you
Who are you

On the television,
Of course they blame the youth for disruption,
Cause they took Fortnum & Mason,
And nothing said about the shooting,
Just the looting

Caught between love and anger,

Don't bring me coffee, I'm somewhere in between.
Baby in the morning, sing me your dreams,
I was saudi drifting and a lion followed me.
The colours I'd not seen before, they were invented in my head,
Or was it that I left this world to the land of the undead?

Where were you last night, (she said) I was playing the flute,
In front of the Eiffel tower to a man in a starlight suit.
Then it was when you came in I recognized your eyes,
You were with the lion and you started to cry.

It'll be okay, be okay, be okay, be okay, be okay, be okay.
Everybody's gone, there's nothing left.

Baby in the morning, pour me your dreams,
Don't bring me coffee, I'm somewhere in between.
Baby in the morning, don't wake me too soon,
I'm lying in satin in the middle of the moon.
Coming down the mountain, I'm not one I'm two
Holy angel, cradle me to the land of the undead.

When everybody's gone, there's nothing left.
When everybody's gone, there's nothing left."

And we are electric together

Are we really moving, are we really here?
Are we just electric or something engineered?
Always there to haunt me, lions in the sand
About to cross back over, then you grab my hand

Are we a simulation, do we really feel?
Flesh can be deceiving; are we caught inside a wheel?
Are you disconnected, do you need somewhere to land?
This is evolution, so please just take my hand

Electric together

When will we believe it, when will we see the light?
Stop running from it; why do we keep denying?
That we can feel it, when we've got each other
And we are electric together
Electric together
Electric together
Electric together
Electric together

Have we hit the ceiling, are we both the same?
Are we still electric, have we come undone again?
Are you searching for the answers, are you looking for the plans?
Why don't we just surrender, please just take my hand

Electric together

When will we believe it, when will we see the light?
Stop running from it; why do we keep denying?
That we can feel it, when we've got each other
And we are electric together
Electric together
Electric together
Electric together
Electric together

Electric together
Electric together
Please just take my hand

When will we believe it, when will we see the light?
Stop running from it; why do we keep denying?
That we can feel it, when we've got each other
And we are electric together

When will we believe it, when will we see the light?
Stop running from it; why do we keep denying?
That we can feel it, when we've got each other
And we are electric together
Electric together
Electric together
Electric together
Electric together
Electric together, when we've got each other
And we are electric together"

And the lunatics taking over
Heaven I found under my demons
And the smoking gun
That you found
Lying on the ground

And the kids are not alright

That's when I find my voice

What you want me to be
I'm not your friend I'm your queen
You're quickly losing your scene
I'm not trying to be what you want me to be

Standing up in front of a mountain
And I don't want to fight
The clouds answer to no one
They don't need the sun
The streets are dark and the gas light leads me
Soon I'm out of sight
Howling back
Back at the moon

I get over, I get under
Don't it make you feel dizzy?
All the anger
I don't mean to be jealous
But my eyes have seen you with fellas
I find it hard to be part of the city when it's so unjust
It makes me feel like I wanna die, that's why

I don't drink alone
(I never drink alone)
I got a big fine mamma at home
(I just can't get enough)
She calls me chicken bone
(My midnight tone)
And then she rolls me like a stone
(I just can't get enough)

Bricked up in the city
And the buildings are laughing
Pay check burning my pocket
Going to buy a gold chain and a locket
Makes me feel like I'm gonna lie, that's why

I don't drink alone

I got a big fine mamma at home
(I just can't get enough)
She calls me chicken bone

She sings when it's over
When it's over she sings
She doesn't worry as I walk out the door
'Cos tomorrow I'll bring
Two small chocolates and a bottle of wine
A very nice time

All my pennies, my farthings
For my mortgage that I'm under
At her place all the sorrows
Of the world can wait 'til tomorrow
She makes me feel like it's all alright, that's why

I don't drink alone

As the kettle whistle blows
Paper back Novelette still open
And the door is closed

You got a real sick mind
You write a column for The Times
For all the lovers gone blind
Who are looking for a sign

And when the night is over
And the drugs are gone
All you've got is your four leaf clover
You keep inside your coat
And when the night is over
And the drugs are gone
You feel the world is getting colder
You got no one to hold

Six pages down and she's lighting up
Her train wreck Soul
She was abandoned by her lover
Left by the road
So apalling scrawling those bullshit words
It's thirsty work
She'll stumble down to the boozer
Just to have a flirt

Pretend we're not lovers just friends

She said, I don't believe in love at first sight
But you can take me home if it feels alright oh baby, oh baby
I said you drink as fast as Hemingway
But you still know all the right words to say oh baby, pretty baby

You always felt so out of place
As the light hits your face
And the dust falls from your eyes
You said you never want to say goodbye
We took a cab to the white light
You said you don't want to end the night
And I said, I'm not a man
I'm not a man to walk away from a connection

And I don't care where I came from
A lucky nail with my name on
I coulda been something special, something brighter
At least I know, I know I'm a fighter
Dharma bums still getting high
And city boys always wondering why
Two lovers on the outside
If you got love you don't have to hide

Waited all my life for you

Moving 'round my mind like you're choreographed
Watching you relaxing at the end of the bed

No planet big enough to fill the space in my heart

Only know the moon 'cause I grew up with his sun

Tried to fall asleep, felt like a fire alarm

Someone call a doctor, I don't feel very well
And there's no point in love if you've got no one to tell
I'm ringing my bell, I'm ringing my bell, I'm ringing my bell

Never gave the joke my permission to land
Thought that it was fresh but all the laughter was canned
Humour doesn't travel but it might need a break
The jokes are getting older, let's just get 'em a cake
Look into the future and there's nobody there
No one that can tell me that my life is unfair
Or answer my prayer, or answer my prayer, or answer my prayer

My mirror a casting director auditioning
Running my lines, I'm increasingly wistful
A mock execution, a pink water pistol
And if I had five minutes on earth with you left
I would keep playing dead until you were impressed
So that I'd not make promises I couldn't keep anymore

I've been working on my mind's interior design
Tryna give this place a little light
Sometimes it feels like I just can't get anything right
But I'd sit in a windowless room every day
Tryna see everything through
If I thought it would give me a panoramic view of you

When digital gangsters were stealing your innocence
I put an order in just to show insolence
Then they got caught and I felt like a failure
So loved you so loud, they could hear in Australia
And then I had five minutes on earth with you left
But I kept playing dead until you were impressed
So that I'd not make promises I couldn't keep anymore

If I thought it would give me a panoramic view of you

Every inch of you built like the Mecca
Bacon, secret sauce, cheese, double-decker
You're the best thing they've got on the menu
Want you while you're still warm
Want you so much that it's become the norm

I've been working on my mind's interior design
Tryna give this place a little light
Sometimes it feels like I just can't get anything right
But I'd sit in a windowless room every day
Tryna see everything through

Remember that night taking Mexican ecstasy?
Codeine, corrido and crashing out next to me
Can't call a cab and I can't read your reply
The Tower of London cut off my free Wi-Fi
So now we've got five minutes on earth with them left

So that we won't make promises we cannot keep anymore"

How many secrets can you keep?

I go crazy 'cause here isn't where I wanna be
And satisfaction feels like a distant memory
And I can't help myself,
All I wanna hear her say is ""Are you mine?""

Well, are you mine?
Are you mine?
Are you mine?

I guess what I'm trying to say
Is I need the deep end
Keep imagining meeting,
Wished away entire lifetimes
Unfair we're not somewhere
Misbehaving for days
Great escape
Lost track of time and space
She's a silver lining climbing on my desire

And I go crazy 'cause here isn't where I wanna be

Well, are you mine? (are you mine tomorrow?)
Are you mine? (or just mine tonight?)

Moves in mysterious ways
So in case I'm mistaken,

Sunglasses indoors, par for the course
Lights in the floors and sweat on the walls
Cages and poles

She calls the folks who run this her oldest friends
Sipping her drink and laughing at imaginary jokes
As all the signals are sent, her eyes invite you to approach
And it seems as though those lumps in your throat
That you just swallowed have got you going

And the nights are drawn out long
And you're kissing to cut through the gloom
With a cough-drop-coloured tongue
And you were sitting in the corner with the coats all piled high
And I thought you might be mine
In a small world on an exceptionally rainy Tuesday night
In the right place and time

When the zeros line up on the 24 hour clock
When you know who's calling even though the number is blocked
When you walked around your house wearing my sky blue Lacoste
And your knee socks

Well you cured my January blues
Yeah you made it all alright
I got a feeling I might have lit the very fuse
That you were trying not to light
You were a stranger in my phone book I was acting like I knew
'Cause I had nothing to lose
When the winter's in full swing and your dreams just aren't coming true
Ain't it funny what you'll do

When the zeros line up on the 24 hour clock
When you know who's calling even though the number is blocked
When you walked around your house wearing my sky blue Lacoste
And your knee socks

The late afternoon
The ghost in your room that you always thought didn't approve of you knocking boots
Never stopped you letting me get hold of the sweet spot by the scruff of your
Knee socks

You and me could have been a team
Each had a half of a king and queen seat
Like the beginning of Mean Streets
You could Be My Baby
[4x]

I found out the hard way that
Here ain't no place for dolls like you and me
Everybody's on a barge
Floating down the endless stream of great TV
1984, 2019

Maybe I was a little too wild in the '70s
Rocket-ship grease down the cracks of my knuckles
Karate bandana, warp speed chic
Hair down to there, impressive moustache
Love came in a bottle with a twist-off cap
Let's all have a swig and do a hot lap

So who you gonna call?
The martini police?

And then I haunt you via the rear view mirror
On a long drive from the back seat

And you recognise that it's ain't how it should be
Your eyes are heavy and the weather's getting ugly
So pull over, I know the place
Don't you know an apparition is a cheap date?
What exactly is it you've been drinking these days?
Jukebox in the corner, long, hot summer
They've got a film up on the wall and it's dark enough to dance
What do you mean you've never seen Blade Runner?

Oh, maybe I was a little too wild in the '70s
Back down to earth with a lounge singer shimmer
Elevator down to my make-believe residency
From the honeymoon suite
Two shows a day, four nights a week
Easy money

So who you gonna call?
The martini police?

I fantasize I call it quits
I swim with the economists
And I get to the bottom of it for good
By the time reality hits
The chimes of freedom fell to bits
The shining city on the fritz
They come out of the cracks
Thirsty for blood

Just as the apocalypse finally gets prioritized
And you cry some of the hottest tears you ever cried
Multiplied by five

That I'd meet so many Lolas
Can I please have my money back?
My virtual reality mask is stuck on ‘Parliament Brawl’
Emergency battery pack, just in time for my weekly chat
With God on video call

Breaking news, they take the truth and make it fluid
The trainer's explanation was accepted by the steward
A montage of the latest ancient ruins
Soundtracked by a chorus of ""You don't know what you're doing""

Explode behind my eyes like American sports

He's got himself a theme tune
They play it for him as he makes his way to the ring

The ascension of the C.R.E.A.M
Mass panic on a not too distant future colony

But in a sexy way where it's not obvious
Highlight dangers and send out hidden messages

In the pocket of my raincoat

Just get a shave and catch some Zzz"

Might be half a love song in it all for you
Timing wise it's probably for the best
Come here and kiss me now before it gets too cute

Mr. Schwartz is staying strong for the crew
Wardrobe's lint rolling your velveteen suit
And smudging dubbin on your dancing shoes

Gradually it's coming into view
It's like your little directorial debut
As fine a time as any to deduce
The fact that neither you or I has ever had a clue

Mr. Schwartz is staying strong for the crew
Wardrobe's lint rolling your velveteen suit
And smudging dubbin on your dancing shoes

And if we guess who I'm pretending to be
Do we win a prize?
Having attempted twice, both incorrectly
Do we get a third try?

The gloved hand's reaching in to hit the switch
And there's not one goddam thing that you can do about it

Mr. Schwartz is having tea with the grips
Asking after all the wives and the kids
It's at the heart of what The Business is"

Having some fun with the warm-up act
If that's what it takes to say goodnight
Then that's what it takes

A four figure sum on a hotel notepad
A revelation or your money back
That's what it takes to say goodnight
Sometimes I wrap my head around it all and it makes perfect sense

Keep reminding me that it ain't a race
When my invincible streak turns onto the final straight
If that's what it takes to say goodnight
Then that's what it takes"

And I touch the hand of God up there, will you still help me choose?

I'm glad you're feeling guilty now that you're better off than some

So I took 'em from their window sill and served 'em à la mode

Help me make my mind up then as you're tying up my shoes
My ego sang me lullabies and my conscience sang the blues
I'm sleeping in the kitchen now, her feet are in the hall
My picture's on her piano, my head is off the wall

They tried to tell me you were cold
And you're impossible to hurt
Now I've heard that said about the both of us

I can't quit

Shutting it up, cutting me up with broken glasses

Get a new man and go to work out with your sister
Talk in a bit, but this it, I'm over it

You can't offer that much to me
Oh you can't offer change, can you?

Havin' it out, livin' in doubt with no defenses
Tighten the rope, and talkin' of hope in different tenses
Callin' my friends and tellin' the only one that answers
It's hard to admit, but this it, I'm over it

I can't quit

If that's how many did, I think I'm screwed

Let's take 'em 'round the back to the cash machine

And if my eyes open for business
Or my heart comes home for Christmas
Then I will take you surfing in the sky
No, I can't walk on water
And if you've ever wondered why
Let me take you surfing in the sky

What do you get when you cross the Rubicon?
With a man whose sense of humor has all gone?
You tell him the one about the one that gets away
So when you take your shot and there's no one left to play

And you've got nothing left to give
I'll give you a month to live
And I will take you surfing in the sky
To keep you out of reach of every other guy
I will take you surfing in the sky
Whoa

I was made to measure
The fastest way to pleasure
So I can take you surfing in the sky
Some say ""hallelujah""
Some, not even ""hi""
So baby let's go surfing in the sky
Baby let's go surfing in the sky
Baby let's go surfing in the sky"

Lost it by playing you wide

That you can't fight fire with the feeling of desire
So I become a bubble-bath for my sociopath
But with the God-given right of the socialite
She said she only thinks of love like a long weekend
But she might jump in if I show her to the deep end

Yeah
And it makes my head feel like a nightclub
It makes my head feel like a nightclub
It makes my head feel like a nightclub
It makes my head

She says that if I wanted romance I could find it in the past
But if I wanna face the music then I only have to ask
So she sings me one I know as if we're sittin' 'round the fire
And there ain't no feeling like the feeling of desire

Yeah

And your self-control, a relative unknown
And you can cut holes into everyone

But got one that pointed at you
So when you skip to the front of the queue
You can tell them that this one's for you
Yeah, tell them that this one's for you

I know people think your mind is a ski resort
But the art of deception is a contact sport

So if you wanna make amends then you make a list
You don't draw blanks on the back of your fist
In the restaurant at the top of your ivory tower
Where the room stopped turning just to save on power

But if you ask her politely enough
Or you kick up enough of a fuss
Then the world might revolve around us
Yeah, the world should revolve around us

And if there's no reservation for two
But the hostess is someone you knew
Then skip to the front of the queue
And tell them that this one's for you
Go tell them that this one's for you

But when I float to the top, it's on a lucky guess
But I only go fishing for negative press
'Cause I've been to the bottom and the bottom is frayed
But the easy way out ain't tailor-made

And I've been to the bottom with you
Where we just do what we want to do
