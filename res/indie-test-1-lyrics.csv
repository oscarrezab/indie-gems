Jenny Was A Friend Of Mine,The Killers,"We took a walk that night, but it wasn't the same
We had a fight on the promenade out in the rain
She said she loved me, but she had somewhere to go
She couldn't scream while I held her close
I swore I'd never let her go

Tell me what you wanna know
Come on, come on
There ain't no motive for this crime
Jenny was a friend of mine
Come on, come on, yeah

I know my rights, I've been here all day and it's time
For me to go, so let me know if it's alright
I just can't take this, I swear I told you the truth
She couldn't scream while I held her close
I swore I'd never let her go

Tell me what you wanna know
Come on, come on
There ain't no motive for this crime
Jenny was a friend of mine
Then you whisper in my ear
""I know what you're doing here""
Come on, come on, yeah

Jenny was a friend of mine
Jenny was a friend of mine
Jenny was a friend of mine
Jenny was a friend of mine"
Mr. Brightside,The Killers,"Coming out of my cage and I've been doing just fine
Gotta, gotta be down, because I want it all
It started out with a kiss, how did it end up like this?
It was only a kiss, it was only a kiss
Now I'm falling asleep and she's calling a cab
While he's having a smoke and she's taking a drag
Now they're going to bed and my stomach is sick
And it's all in my head, but she's touching his

Chest now, he takes off her
Dress now, let me go
And I just can't look, it's killing me
They're taking control

Jealousy, turning saints into the sea
Swimming through sick lullabies, choking on your alibis
But it's just the price I pay, destiny is calling me
Open up my eager eyes, 'cause I'm Mr. Brightside

I'm coming out of my cage and I've been doing just fine
Gotta, gotta be down, because I want it all
It started out with a kiss, how did it end up like this?
It was only a kiss, it was only a kiss
Now I'm falling asleep and she's calling a cab
While he's having a smoke and she's taking a drag
Now they're going to bed and my stomach is sick
And it's all in my head, but she's touching his

Chest now, he takes off her
Dress now, let me go
'Cause I just can't look, it's killing me
They're taking control

Jealousy, turning saints into the sea
Swimming through sick lullabies, choking on your alibis
But it's just the price I pay, destiny is calling me
Open up my eager eyes, 'cause I'm Mr. Brightside

I never...
I never...

Smile Like You Mean It,The Killers,"Save some face, you know you've only got one
Change your ways while you're young
Boy, one day you'll be a man
Oh girl, he'll help you understand

Smile like you mean it
Smile like you mean it

Looking back at sunsets on the Eastside
We lost track of the time
Dreams aren't what they used to be
Some things sat by so carelessly

Smile like you mean it
Smile like you mean it

And someone is calling my name
From the back of the restaurant
And someone is playing a game
In the house that I grew up in
And someone will drive her around
Down the same streets that I did
On the same streets that I did

Smile like you mean it
Smile like you mean it
Smile like you mean it
Smile like you mean it

Oh no, oh no, oh no no no
Oh no, oh no..."
Somebody Told Me,The Killers,"One, two, three, four

I'm breaking my back just to know your name
Seventeen tracks and I've had it with this game
I'm breaking my back just to know your name
But heaven ain't close in a place like this
Anything goes but don't blink, you might miss

'Cause heaven ain't close in a place like this
I said, heaven ain't close in a place like this
So bring it back down, bring it back down tonight
Never thought I'd let a rumor ruin my moonlight

Yes, somebody told me that you had a boyfriend
Who looked like a girlfriend that I had in February of last year
It's not confidential, I've got potential
Rushing and rushing around

Ready, let's roll onto something new
Taking its toll then I'm leaving without you
'Cause heaven ain't close in a place like this
I said, heaven ain't close in a place like this
So bring it back down, bring it back down tonight
Never thought I'd let a rumor ruin my moonlight

Yes, somebody told me that you had a boyfriend
Who looked like a girlfriend that I had in February of last year
It's not confidential, I've got potential
Rushing and rushing around

Pace yourself for me
I said maybe, baby, please
But I just don't know now (Baby, baby)
When all I wanna do is try

All These Things That I've Done,The Killers,"When there's nowhere else to run
Is there room for one more son? One more son
If you can hold on
If you can hold on, hold on

I wanna stand up, I wanna let go
You know, you know; no, you don't, you don't
I wanna shine on in the hearts of man
I want a meaning from the back of my broken hand
Another head aches, another heart breaks
I'm so much older than I can take
And my affection, well, it comes and goes
I need direction to perfection, no, no, no, no

Help me out
Yeah, you know you got to help me out
Yeah, oh, don't you put me on the back burner
You know you got to help me out, yeah

"Andy, You're A Star",The Killers,"On the field I remember you were incredible
Hey, shut up, hey, shut up, yeah

On the field I remember you were incredible
Hey, shut up, hey, shut up, yeah

On the match with the boys, you think you're alone
With the pain that you drain from love
In a car with a girl, promise me she's not your world
'Cause Andy, you're a star
Get down

Leave your number on the locker and I'll give you a call
Hey, shut up, hey, shut up, yeah

Leave your legacy in gold on the plaques that line the hall
Hey, shut up, hey, shut up, yeah

On the streets, such a sweet face jumping in town
In the staff room, the verdict is in
In a car with a girl, promise me she's not your world
'Cause Andy, you're a star

In nobody's eyes but mine
Andy, you're a star
In nobody's eyes but mine
Andy, you're a star
In nobody's eyes

On Top,The Killers,"Remember Rio and get down
Like some other DJ, in some other town
She's been trying to tell me to hold tight
But I've been waiting this whole night
But I've been down across a road or two
But now I've found the velvet sun
That shines on me and you

In the back, ah-ho, I can't crack
We're on top
It's just a shimmy and a shake, ah-ho
I can't fake, we're on top, we're on top

The day is breaking, we're still here
Your body's shaking and it's clear
You really need it, so let go
And let me feed it, but you know
That I've been down across a road or two
But now I've found the velvet sun
That shines on me and you

In the back, ah-ho, I can't crack
We're on top
It's just a shimmy and a shake, ah-ho
I can't fake, we're on top, we're on top
We bring the bump to the grind, ah-ho
I don't mind, we're on top
It's just a shimmy and a shake, ah-ho
I can't fake, we're on top, we're on top

And we don't mean to satisfy tonight
So get your eyes off of my pride tonight
'Cause I don't need to satisfy tonight
It's like a cigarette in the mouth
Or a handshake in the doorway
I look at you and smile because I'm fine

And we don't mean to satisfy tonight
So get your eyes off of my pride tonight
'Cause I don't need to satisfy tonight
It's like a cigarette in the mouth

Glamorous Indie Rock & Roll,The Killers,"Glamorous indie rock and roll is what I want
It's in my soul, it's what I need
Indie rock and roll, it's time
Two of us flipping through a thrift store magazine
She plays the drums, I'm on tambourine
Bet your, your bottom dollar on me

It's indie rock and roll for me
It's indie rock and roll for me
It's all I need
It's indie rock and roll for me

In a clutch, I'm talking every word for all the boys
Electric girls with worn-down toys
Make it up, break it up, what do you care?
Oh, what do you care?
I take my twist with a shout
A coffee shop with a cause, then I'll freak you out
No sex, no drugs, no life, no love
When it comes to today

Stay if you want to love me, stay
Oh, don't be shy, let's cause a scene
Like lovers do on silver screens
Let's make it, yeah, we'll cause a scene

It's indie rock and roll for me
It's indie rock and roll for me
It's all I need

Believe Me Natalie,The Killers,"Believe me, Natalie, listen, Natalie
This is your last chance to find a go-go dance to disco now
Please believe me, Natalie, listen Natalie
This is your last chance to find a go-go dance to disco now
Forget what they said in SoHo, leave the ""Oh, no""s out
And believe me, Natalie, listen Natalie
This is your last chance

There is an old cliche under your Monet, baby
Remember the arch of roses right above your couch?
Forget what they said in SoHo, leave the ""Oh, no""s out
Yes, there is an old cliche under your Monet, baby

You left the station now to the floor with speculation
What was it for?
In that old hallway, Mom says, ""Why don't you stay?
You've been away for a long time""

Believe me, Natalie
This is your last chance to find a go-go
Forget what they said in SoHo
And walk away
If my dreams for us can't get you through just one more day
It's alright by me

God, help me somehow
There's no time for survival left
The time is now
'Cause this might be your last chance to disco, oh-oh, oh-oh"
Midnight Show,The Killers,"I know what you want
I'm gonna take you to a midnight show tonight
If you can keep a secret
I got a blanket in the back seat on my mind

And a little place that sits beneath the sky
She turned her face to speak but no-one heard her cry

Drive faster, boy
Drive faster, boy, ooh, yeah-ooh

I know there's a hope
There's too many people trying to help me cope
You got a real short skirt
I wanna look up, look up, look up, yeah, yeah
We were just in time
Let me take a little more off your mind
There's something in my head, somewhere in the back, saying
""We were just a good thing, we were such a good thing""

Make it go away without a word
But promise me you'll stay and fix these things I've heard

Oh, make it go away
Drive faster, boy, ooh, yeah-ooh
Oh, no

A crashing tide can't hide a guilty girl
With jealous hearts that start with gloss and curls
I took my baby's breath beneath the chandelier
Of stars in atmosphere and watched her disappear

Into the midnight show
Faster, faster, faster, faster, faster, faster
Oh no, no, no, no, no, no
No, no, no, no, no

If you can keep a secret
Well, baby, I can keep it if you can keep a secret
(She said she loved me)
If you can keep a secret, I can keep a secret
(She said she loved me)
If you can keep a secret
Well, baby, I can keep it if you can keep a secret

Everything Will Be Alright,The Killers,"Doo-doo, doo-doo
I believe in you and me

I'm coming to find you if it takes me all night
Wrong until you make it right

At least I'll try and run, and run tonight

Everything will be alright
Everything will be alright
Everything will be alright
Everything will be alright
Everything will be alright

Alright, alright, alright, alright

I wasn't shopping for a doll
To say the least, I thought I'd seen them all
But then you took me by surprise
I'm dreaming 'bout those dreamy eyes
I never knew, I never knew
So take your suitcase, 'cause I don't mind
And baby doll, I meant it every time
You don't need to compromise
I'm dreaming 'bout those dreamy eyes

Sam's Town,The Killers,"Nobody ever had a dream round here
But I don't really mind that it's starting to get to me
Nobody ever pulls the seams round here
But I don't really mind that it's starting to get to me

I've got this energy beneath my feet
Like something underground's going to come up and carry me
I've got this sentimental heart that beats
But I don't really mind that it's starting to get to me now

Why do you waste my time?
Is the answer to the question on your mind
And I'm sick of all my judges
So scared of what they'll find
But I know that I can make it
As long as somebody takes me home every now and then

Well have you ever seen the lights?
Have you ever seen the lights?

I took a shuttle on a shock wave ride
Where people on the pen pull the trigger for accolades
I took a bullet and I looked inside
Running through my veins an American masquerade

I still remember grandma Dixie's wake
I've never really known anybody to die before
Red, white and blue upon a birthday cake
My brother, he was born on the fourth of the July and that's all

So why do you waste my time?
Is the answer to the question on your mind
And I'm sick of all my judges
So scared of what they'll find
But I know that I can make it
As long as somebody takes me home every now and then

Every now and then
Every now and then

You know I see London, I see Sam's Town
Holds my hand and lets my hair down
Rolls that world right off my shoulder
I see London, I see Sam's Town now"
When You Were Young,The Killers,"You sit there in your heartache
Waiting on some beautiful boy to
To save you from your old ways
You play forgiveness
Watch it now
Here he comes

He doesn't look a thing like Jesus
But he talks like a gentleman
Like you imagined
When you were young

Can we climb this mountain
I don't know
Higher now than ever before
I know we can make it if we take it slow
Let's take it easy
Easy now
Watch it go

We're burning down the highway skyline
On the back of a hurricane
That started turning
When you were young
When you were young

And sometimes you close your eyes
And see the place where you used to live
When you were young

They say the devil's water
It ain't so sweet
You don't have to drink right now
But you can dip your feet
Every once in a little while

You sit there in your heartache
Waiting on some beautiful boy to
To save you from your old ways
You play forgiveness
Watch it now
Here he comes

He doesn't look a thing like Jesus
But he talks like a gentleman
Like you imagined
When you were young
(Talks like a gentleman)
(Like you imagined)
When you were young

I said he doesn't look a thing like Jesus
He doesn't look a thing like Jesus
But more than you'll ever know"
Bling (Confession Of A King),The Killers,"When I offer you survival
You say it's hard enough to live
It's not so bad, it's not so bad
How do you know that you're right?

I awoke on the roadside
In the land of the free ride
And I can't pull it any longer
The sun is beating down my neck
So I ran with the devil
Left a trail of excuses
Like a stone on the water
The elements decide my fate
Watch it go

When I offer you survival
You say it's hard enough to live
Don't tell me that it's over, stand up
Poor and tired, but more than this
How do you know that you're right?
If you're not nervous anymore
It's not so bad, it's not so bad

I feel my vision slipping in and out of focus
But I'm pushing on for that horizon
I'm pushing on
Now I've got that blowing wind against my face
So you sling rocks at the riptide
Am I wrong or am I right?
I hit the bottom with a ""huh!"", quite strange
I get my glory in the desert rain
Watch it go (When I offer you survival)

When I offer you survival
You say it's hard enough to live
And I'll tell you when it's over, shut up
Poor and tired, but more than this
How do you know that you're right?
If you're not nervous anymore
It's not so bad, it's not so bad

Higher and higher
We're gonna take it down to the wire
We're gonna make it out of the fire
Higher and higher, higher and higher
We're gonna take it down to the wire
We're gonna make it out of the fire
Higher and higher, higher and higher
We're gonna take it down to the wire
We're gonna make it out, whoa-oh-oh
Higher and higher

It ain't hard to hold
When it shines like gold
You'll remember me"
For Reasons Unknown,The Killers,"I pack my case. I check my face
I look a little bit older
I look a little bit colder
With one deep breath, and one big step, I move a little bit closer
I move a little bit closer
For reasons unknown

I caught my stride
I flew and flied
I know if destiny's kind, I've got the rest of my mind
But my heart, it don't beat, it don't beat the way it used to
And my eyes, they don't see you no more
And my lips, they don't kiss, they don't kiss the way they used to, and my eyes don't recognize you no more

For reasons unknown; for reasons unknown

There was an open chair
We sat down in the open chair
I said if destiny's kind, I've got the rest of my mind
But my heart, it don't beat, it don't beat the way it used to
And my eyes, they don't see you no more
And my lips, they don't kiss, they don't kiss the way they used to, and my eyes don't recognize you at all

For reasons unknown; for reasons unknown

I said my heart, it don't beat, it don't beat the way it used to and my eyes don't recognize you no more
And my lips, they don't kiss, they don't kiss the way they used to, and my eyes don't recognize you no more

Read My Mind,The Killers,"On the corner of Main Street
Just trying to keep it in line
You say you wanna move on and
You say I'm falling behind
Can you read my mind?
Can you read my mind?

I never really gave up on
Breaking out of this two-star town
I got the green light, I got a little fight
I'm gonna turn this thing around
Can you read my mind? (Oooh)
Can you read my mind? (Oooh)

The good old days, the honest man
The restless heart, the Promised Land
A subtle kiss that no one sees
A broken wrist and a big trapeze
Oh, well, I don't mind if you don't mind
'Cause I don't shine if you don't shine
Before you go, can you read my mind?

It's funny how you just break down
Waiting on some sign
I pull up to the front of your driveway
With magic soaking my spine
Can you read my mind? (Oooh)
Can you read my mind? (Oooh)

The teenage queen, the loaded gun
The drop dead dream, the Chosen One
A southern drawl, a world unseen
A city wall and a trampoline
Oh, well, I don't mind, if you don't mind
'Cause I don't shine if you don't shine
Before you jump, tell me what you find
When you read my mind

Slipping in my faith until I fall
He never returned that call
Woman, open the door, don't let it sting
I wanna breathe that fire again
She said, ""I don't mind, if you don't mind (I don't mind, if you don't mind)
'Cause I don't shine if you don't shine"" (I don't shine if you don't shine)
Put your back on me, put your back on me (I don't mind, if you don't mind)

Can you read my mind? (Oooh oooh)"
Uncle Jonny,The Killers,"When everybody else refrained

Bones,The Killers,"Come with me

We took a back road
We're gonna look at the stars
We took a backroad in my car
Down to the ocean
It's only water and sand
And in the ocean we'll hold hands

But I don't really like you, apologetically dressed in the best, put on a heartbeat glide
Without an answer, the thunder speaks for the sky, and on the cold wet dirt I cry
And on the cold wet dirt I cry

Don't you wanna come with me? Don't you wanna feel my bones
On your bones?
It's only natural

A cinematic vision ensued
Like the holiest dream
There's someone calling
An angel whispers my name
But the message relayed is the same:
""Wait till tomorrow, you'll be fine.""
But it's gone to the dogs in my mind
I always hear them when the dead of night
Comes calling to save me from this fight
But they can never wrong this right

Don't you wanna come with me? Don't you wanna feel my bones
On your bones?
It's only natural
Don't you wanna swim with me? Don't you wanna feel my skin
On your skin?
It's only natural

I never had a lover
(Never had soul)
I never had soul

My List,The Killers,"Let me wrap myself around you
Let you show me how I see
And when you come back in from nowhere
Do you ever think of me?
Your heart is not able
Let me show you how much I care
I need those eyes to tide me over
I'll take your picture when I go
It gives me strength and gives me patience
But I'll never let you know
I got nothing on you baby
But I always said I try
Let me show you how much I care

Don't give the ghost up just clench your fist
You should have known by now you were on my list

This River Is Wild,The Killers,"Leaves are fallin' down on the beautiful ground
I heard a story from the man in red
He said, ""The leaves are fallin' down, such a beautiful sound
Son, I think you'd better go ahead""
But you always hold your head up high
'Cause it's a long, long, long way down
This town was meant for passing through
Boy, it ain't nothin' new
Now go and show 'em that the world stayed round
But it's a long, long, long way down

You better run for the hills before they burn
Listen to the sound of the world, don't watch it turn
I just want to show you what I know
And catch you when the current lets you go

Or should I just get along with myself?
I never did get along with everybody else
I've been trying hard to do what's right
But you know I could stay here all night
And watch the clouds fall from the sky
Well, this river is wild
This river is wild

Run for the hills before they burn
Listen to the sound of the world, don't watch it turn
(I shake a little) Sometimes I'm nervous when I talk
(I shake a little) Sometimes I hate the line I walk
I just wanna to show you what I know

Or should I just get along with myself?
I never did get along with everybody else
I've been trying hard to do what's right
But you know I could stay here all night
And watch the clouds fall from the sky
Because this river is wild, godspeed ya, boy
This river is wild

Now Adam's taking bombs and he's stuck on his mom
Because that bitch keeps trying to make him pray
He's with the hippie in the park, combing over the dark
Just trying to get some of that little-girl play

You better run for the hills before they burn
Listen to the sound of the world, don't watch it turn
I just want to show you what I know
And catch you when the current lets you go

Or should I get along with myself?
I never did get along with everybody else
I've been trying hard to do what's right
But you know I could stay here all night
And watch the clouds fall from the sky
The pain is hell in me tonight
Because this river is wild, godspeed ya, boy
This river is wild
This river is wild, godspeed ya, boy
This river is wild

Now the cars are everywhere, raisin' dust at the fairground
I don't think I ever seen so many headlights
But there's something pulling me
The circus and the crew, well, they're just passing through
Making sure the merry still goes 'round
But it's a long, long, long way down"
Why Do I Keep Counting?,The Killers,"There's a plane and I am flying
There's a mountain waiting for me
Oh these years have been so trying
I don't know if I can use them
Am I strong enough
To be the one?
(Am I strong enough to be the one?)
Will I live to have some children?
(Children)

Help me get down
I can make it
Help me get down
Help me get down
I can make it
Help me get down

If I only knew the answer
I wouldn't be bothering you, father

Help me get down
I can make it
Help me get down
Help me get down
I can make it
Help me get down

If I only knew the answer
And if all our days are numbered
Then why do I keep counting?

My sugar sweet is so attainable
This behavior so unexplainable
The days just slip and slide
Like they always did
The trouble is my head
Won't let me forget
I took one last good look around
So many unusual sounds
I gotta get my feet on the ground

Help me get down
I can make it (oh)
Help me get down
I can make it, help me get down
Help me get down
I can make it, help me get down
If I only knew the answer
I wouldn't be bothering you, father
Help me get down
I can make it, help me get down
Help me get down
I can make it, help me get down
If I only knew the answer
And if all our days are numbered
Would you help me get down? (I can make it, help me get down)
(Help me get down)
(I can make it, help me get down)

If I only knew the answer
If I change my way of living
And if I pave my streets with good times
Will the mountain keep on giving?

And if all of our days are numbered
Then why do I keep counting?"
Losing Touch,The Killers,"Console me in my darkest hour
Convince me that the truth is always gray
Caress me in your velvet chair
Conceal me from the ghost you cast away

I ain't in no hurry
You go run and tell your friends I'm losing touch
Fill their heads with rumors of impending doom
It must be true

Console me in my darkest hour
And tell me that you always hear my cries
I wonder what you've got conspired
I'm sure it dawns a consolation prize

I ain't in no hurry
You go run and tell your friends I'm losing touch
Fill the night with stories, the legend grows
Of how you got lost
But you made your way back home
You sold your soul
Like a roamin' vagabond, yeah

I heard you found a wishing well in the city
Console me in my darkest hour
Then you throw me down
I ain't in no hurry
You go run and tell your friends I'm losing touch
Fill your crown with rumors
Impending doom, it must be true

But you made your way back home
You sold your soul like a roamin' vagabond
And about how you got lost
But you made your way back home
You went and sold your soul
An allegiance dead and gone
I'm losing touch"
Human,The Killers,"I did my best to notice
When the call came down the line
Up to the platform of surrender
I was brought, but I was kind
And sometimes I get nervous
When I see an open door
Close your eyes, clear your heart

Cut the cord

Are we human
Or are we dancer?
My sign is vital
My hands are cold
And I'm on my knees
Looking for the answer
Are we human
Or are we dancer?

Pay my respects to grace and virtue
Send my condolences to good
Give my regards to soul and romance
They always did the best they could
And so long to devotion
You taught me everything I know
Wave goodbye, wish me well

You've got to let me go

Are we human
Or are we dancer?
My sign is vital
My hands are cold
And I'm on my knees
Looking for the answer
Are we human
Or are we dancer?

Will your system be alright
When you dream of home tonight?
There is no message we're receiving
Let me know, is your heart still beating?

Are we human
Or are we dancer?
My sign is vital
My hands are cold
And I'm on my knees
Looking for the answer

You've got to let me know

Are we human
Or are we dancer?
My sign is vital
My hands are cold
And I'm on my knees
Looking for the answer
Are we human
Or are we dancer?

Are we human
Or are we dancer?
Are we human
Or are we dancer?"
Spaceman,The Killers,"It started with a low light
Next thing I knew, they ripped me from my bed
And then they took my blood type
It left a strange impression in my head
You know that I was hoping
That I could leave this star-crossed world behind
But when they cut me open
I guess I changed my mind

And you know, I might
Have just flown too far from the floor this time
'Cause they're calling me by my name
And they're zipping white light beams
Disregarding bombs and satellites
That was the turning point
That was one lonely night

The storm maker says, ""It ain't so bad""
The dream maker's gonna make you mad
The spaceman says, ""Everybody, look down
It's all in your mind""

Well, now I'm back at home, and
I'm looking forward to this life I live
You know it's gonna haunt me
So hesitation to this life I give
You think you might cross over
You're caught between the devil and the deep blue sea
You'd better look it over
Before you make that leap

And you know I'm fine
But I hear those voices at night sometimes
They justify my claim
And the public don't dwell on my transmission
'Cause it wasn't televised
But it was the turning point
Oh, what a lonely night

The storm maker says, ""It ain't so bad""
The dream maker's gonna make you mad
The spaceman says, ""Everybody, look down
It's all in your mind""
The storm maker says, ""It ain't so bad""
The dream maker's gonna make you mad
The spaceman says, ""Everybody, look down
It's all in your mind""

My global position systems are vocally addressed
They say the Nile used to run from east to west
They say the Nile used to run
From east to west

I'm fine
But I hear those voices at night
Sometimes

The storm maker says, ""It ain't so bad""
The dream maker's gonna make you mad
The spaceman says, ""Everybody, look down
It's all in your mind""
The storm maker says, ""It ain't so bad""
The dream maker's gonna make you mad
The spaceman says, ""Everybody, look down
It's all in your mind""

It's all in my mind
It's all in my mind"
Joy Ride,The Killers,"It's getting close to sundown
Over the Sierra
Stranded on the heat wave
Burning with desire
She was on the sidewalk
Looking for a nightlife
Talked about the real thing
And drove into the fire
Headlights on the highway
The desert wind is howling
Rattlesnakes and romance
Are spilling with the rain
Candy apple red dress
Bleeding when she kissed me
Heaven in a rag top
Takes away my-my pain

When your chips are down
When your highs are low
Joy ride
(Joy ride)
Move across the night like a separate wind
(Joy ride)

Pulled up to a motel
Vacancy was buzzing
Pink and dirty neon
Settled on the hood
Wrapped her arms around me
Come a little closer
Stumbled in the twilight
And fell onto the floor of the Mona Lisa
Dreaming of the free world
Lipstick on the nightstand
And demons at the door

When your chips are down
When your highs are low
Joy ride
(Joy ride)
Move across the night like a separate wind
(Joy ride)
When your hopes and dreams
Lose the will to go
Joy ride
(Joy ride)
Reaching for the light
More than we can win
(Joy ride)

There's something in the distance
A glorious existence
A simple celebration
A place you never been before
(Why don't you kiss me?)
Tell me that you want it more

Reaching for the light
More than we can win
When your chips are down
(When your chips are down)
When your highs are low
Joy ride
(Joy ride)
All your hopes and dreams
All you need to know
Joy ride

A Dustland Fairytale,The Killers,"A Dustland fairytale beginning
With just another white trash county kiss
In '61, long brown hair and foolish eyes
He looked just like you'd want him to
Some kind of slick chrome American prince
A blue jean serenade
Moon River what'd you do to me
I don't believe you

Saw Cinderella in a party dress but
She was looking for a night gown
I saw the devil wrapping up his hands
He's getting ready for the showdown
I saw the minute that I turned away
I got my money on a pawn tonight

The change came in disguise of revelation, set his soul on fire
She said she'd always knew he'd come around
And the decades disappear like sinking ships, but we persevere
God gives us hope, but we still fear what we don't know
The mind is poison
Castles in the sky sit stranded vandalized
We're drawbridges closing

Saw Cinderella in a party dress
But she was looking for a nightgown
I saw the devil wrapping up his hands
He's getting ready for the showdown
I saw the ending when they turned the page
I threw my money and I ran away
Straight to the valley of the great divide

Out where the dreams all hide
Out where the wind don't blow
Out here the good girls die
And the sky won't snow
Out here the bird don't sing
Out here the field don't grow
Out here the bell don't ring
Out here the bell don't ring
Out here the good girls die

Now Cinderella don't you go to sleep
It's such a bitter form of refuge
Why don't you know the kingdom's under siege
And everybody needs you
Is there still magic in the midnight sun
Or did you leave it back in sixty-one
In the cadence of a young man's eyes
Out where the dreams all hide"
This Is Your Life,The Killers,"Candy talks to strangers
Thinks her life's in danger
No one gives a damn about her hair
It's lonely down on Track Street
She used to go by Jackie
The cops, they'll steal your dreams and they'll kill your prayers
Take a number where the blood just barely dried

Wait for something better
No one behind you
Watching your shadows
This feeling won't go

Crooked wheels keep turning
Children, are you learning
Acclimatized, but don't you lose the plot
A history of blisters
Your brothers and your sisters
Somewhere in the pages we forgot

Take a number Jackie
Where the blood just barely dried
You know I'm on your side

Wait for something better
No one behind you
Watching your shadows
You got to be stronger than the story
Don't let it blind you
Rivers are shallow
This feeling won't go

Your sky is full of dreams
But you don't know how to fly
I don't have a simple answer
But I know that I could answer
Something better

This feeling won't go
Wait for it
Wait for it
Wait for it
Wait for it"
I Can't Stay,The Killers,"The emotion it was electric
And the stars, they all aligned
I knew I had to make my decision
But I never made the time
No, I never made the time

In the dark, for a while now
I can't stay, so far
I can't stay much longer
Riding my decision home

Exoneration lost his eraser
But my forgiver found the sun
And there are twisted days that I take comfort
Because I'm not the only one
No, I'm not the only one

In the dark, for a while now
I can't stay, very far
I can't stay much longer
Riding my decision home

Now there's a majesty at my doorstep
And there's a little boy in her arms
Now we'll parade around without game plans
Obligation or alarm

In the dark, for a while now
I can't stay, very far
I can't stay much longer
Riding my decision home
In the dark, for a while now
I can't stay, so far
I can't stay much longer
Riding my decision home
In the dark"
Neon Tiger,The Killers,"Far from the evergreen of old Assam
Far from the rainfall on the trails of old Saigon
Straight from the poster town of scorn and Ritz
To bring you the wilder side of gold and glitz

Run neon tiger there's a lot on your mind
They promised just to pet you, but don't you let them get you
Away, away, oh, run
Under heat of the southwest sun

Took to the spotlight like a diamond ring
Came from the woodwork in the hopes they might
Redeem themselves from poor decisions to win big

Run neon tiger there's a lot on your mind
They'll strategize and maim you, but don't you let them tame you
You're far too pure and bold
To suffer the strain of the hand and its hold

I don't want to be kept, I don't want to be caged
I don't want to be damned, oh hell
I don't want to be broke, I don't want to be saved
I don't want to be S.O.L
Give me rolling hills and tonight can be the night
That I stand among the thousand thrills
Mister cut me some slack, cause I don't want to go back
I want a new day and age
Come on girls and boys, everyone make some noise!

Run neon tiger there's a price on your head
They'll hunt you down and gut you, I'll never let 'em touch you
Away, away, oh, run
I'm begging you neon tiger run
Under the heat of
Under the heat of
Under the heat of southwest sun

The World We Live In,The Killers,"This is the world that we live in
I feel myself get tired
This is the world that we live in

Well maybe I was mistaken
I heard a rumor that you quit this day and age
Well maybe I was mistaken

Bless your body, bless your soul
Pray for peace and self-control

I gotta believe it's worth it
Without a victory
I'm so sanctified and free
Well maybe I'm just mistaken

Lesson learned and the wheels keep turning

This is the world that we live in
I can't take blame for two
This is the world that we live in
And maybe we'll make it through

Bless your body, bless your soul
Reel me in and cut my throat

Underneath the waterfall
Baby, we're still in this boat

This is the world that we live in
I feel myself get tired
This is the world that we live in

I had a dream that I was falling, down
There's no next time around
A storm wastes its water on me
But my life was free

I guess it's the world that we live in
It's not too late for that
This is the world that we live in
And no, we can't go back

This is the world that we live in
I still want something real
This is the world that we live in
I know that we can heal over time

This is the world that we live in"
"Goodnight, Travel Well",The Killers,"The unknown distance to the great beyond
Stares back at my grieving frame
To cast my shadow by the holy sun
My spirit moans with a sacred pain
And it's quiet now
The universe is standing still

There's nothing I can say
There's nothing we can do now
There's nothing I can say
There's nothing we can do now

And all that stands between the souls release
This temporary flesh and bone
We know that it's over now
I feel my faded mind begin to roam

Every time you fall
And every time you try
Every foolish dream
And every compromise
Every word you spoke
And everything you said
Everything you left me, rambles in my head

There's nothing I can say
There's nothing we can do now
There's nothing I can say
There's nothing we can do now

Up above the world so high

And everything you loved
And every time you try
Everybody's watching
Everybody cry

Stay, don't leave me
The stars can wait for your sign
Don't signal now

There's nothing I can say
There's nothing we can do now
There's nothing I can say
There's nothing we can do now

Goodnight, travel well
Goodnight, travel well

And there's nothing I can say
There's nothing I can do now

Goodnight, travel well
Travel well, travel well"
Tidal Wave - Bonus Track,The Killers,"He's always trouble with his non-complacence
Shotgun eyes, shotgun eyes
His subtlety, his mystery
Not like the other guys

She's always taken by his reputation
He's so bad, he's so bad
On Saturday night, they're running for the shadow

You say your heart ain't ever been broken
You think you know where you're going
Tidal wave, tidal wave come rushing over me
You say this life has given you nothing
You got another thing coming
Tidal wave, tidal wave come rushing over me

He'll get a warning sign to keep his distance
From her old man, from her old man
Now the story of forbidden love
Has got to make a stand

So in the middle of the early morning
They'll slip away, slip away
And we know they'll do their best
Somewhere in the golden west
Oh yeah, and we'll watch them drive
They're so alive

You say your heart ain't ever been broken
You think you know where you're going
Tidal wave, tidal wave come rushing over me
You say this life has given you nothing
You got another thing coming
Tidal wave, tidal wave come rushing over me
Tidal wave

Come together, can't you see
Tidal wave going to cover me

Cover me
I can't go back

Forget About What I Said - Bonus Track,The Killers,"We used to tear it down
But now we just exist
The things that I did wrong
I'll bet you've got a list

Now I know how you remember
And those moments that you choose
Will define me as a traitor
Stealing everything you lose

Forget about what I said
The lights are gone and the parties over
Forget about what I said
Forget about what I said
I'm older now and I know you hear me
Forget about what I said

You'll stay up late tonight
You'll turn off your phone
Well you were selfish too
But you were never all alone
In those ugly pink apartments
With the hustlers and the kids
Mapping out some retribution
Do we have to go through this?

Forget about what I said
The lights are gone and the party's over
Forget about what I said
Forget about what I said
I'm older now and I know you hear me
Forget about what I said

All of the stars are wandering around tonight
We used to try them on
And sometimes I hear you
The galaxy sings your song
And tonight I sing along

Forget about what I said
The lights are gone and the parties over
Forget about what I said
Forget about what I said
I'm older now and I know you hear me
Forget about what I said
Forget about what I said"
Flesh And Bone,The Killers,"I've gone through life
White-knuckled in the moments that left me behind
Refusing to heed the yield
I penetrate the force fields in the blind
They say I'll adjust
God knows I must
But I'm not sure how
This natural selection picked me out to be
A dark horse running in a fantasy

Flesh and bone
Am I running out of time?
Flesh and bone

Somewhere outside that finish line
I square up and break through the chains
And I head like a raging bull
Anointed by the blood, I take the reins
Cut from the cloth, of a flag that
Bears the name of ""Battle Born""
They call me the contender
Listen for the bell
My face flashing crimson from the fires of hell
What are you afraid of?

And what are you made of?
Flesh and bone
And I'm running out of time
Flesh and bone
And what are you made of?
Flesh and bone
Man I'm turning on a dime
Flesh and bone

This could decay
Like the valley below
Defenses are down
The stakes are high
(Scouting the crowd for a face of compassion)
The fairytale end
(To face off the journey that fathers no more)
The staggering blow
(You'll find the truth in the roots of desire)
You lead with your chin
(Thinkin' with your corners, just a compass and the sun)
This could be real
(Thinkin' with your corners, just a)
Simple

And what are you made of?
(Flesh and bone)
And I'm running out of time
(Flesh and bone)
What are you made of?

He faces forward
Trading in his blindness for the glow of love
And time is raging, may it rage in vain
And you always had it, but you never knew
So boots and saddles, get on your feet
There's no surrender, cause there's no retreat
The bells are sobbing, in this monster land
We are the descendants of giant men"
Runaways,The Killers,"Blonde hair blowing in the summer wind
A blue-eyed girl playing in the sand
I'd been on her trail for a little while
But that was the night that she broke down and held my hand
A teenage rush
She said, ""Ain't we all just runaways? We got time""

But that ain't much
We can't wait 'til tomorrow
You got to know that this is real, baby, why you want to fight it?
It's the one thing you can choose, oh!

We got engaged on a Friday night
I swore on the head of our unborn child
That I could take care of the three of us
But I got the tendency to slip when the nights get wild
It's in my blood
She said she might just runaway somewhere else
Someplace good

We can't wait 'til tomorrow
You got to know that this is real, baby, why you want to fight it?
It's the one thing you can choose
Let's take a chance baby, we can't lose

Ain't we all just runaways?
I knew it when I met you, I'm not going to let you runaway
I knew it when I held you, I wasn't letting go!

We used to look at the stars and confess our dreams
Hold each other 'til the morning light
We used to laugh, now we only fight
Baby are you lonesome now?

At night I come home after they go to sleep
Like a stumbling ghost, I haunt these halls
There's a picture of us on our wedding day
I recognize the girl but I can't settle in these walls

We can't wait 'til tomorrow
Oh, we're caught up in the appeal baby, why you wanna hide it?
It's the last thing on my mind (Why you want to hide it?)
I turn the engine over and my body just comes alive

Ain't we all just runaways?
I knew it when I met you, I'm not going to let you run away
I knew it when I held you, I wasn't letting go!

Oh! Oh! Oh!

Ain't we all just runaways?
Yeah, runaways
Ain't we all just runaways?
Yeah"
The Way It Was,The Killers,"I drove through the desert last night
I carried the weight of our last fight
Elvis singing don't be cruel, and I wonder if you feel it too
It's like we're going under
Somewhere outside the lonely Esmeralda county line
The question of my heart came to my mind

If I go on with you (by my side)
Can it be the way it was?
When we met, did you forget all about those golden nights?

Maybe a thief stole your heart
Or maybe we just drifted apart
I remember driving in my daddy's car to the airfield
Blanket on the hood, backs against the windshield
Back then this thing was running on momentum, love and trust
That paradise is buried in the dust

If I go on with you (by my side)
Can it be the way it was?
When we met, did you forget all about those golden nights?
(The way it was, it was)

All of our plans have fallen through
Sometimes a dream don't come true

Darling! Darling!
If we go on
Can it be the way it was
When we met did you forget all about them golden nights?
If I go on with you by my side
Can it be the way it was
My heart is true, girl it's just you I'm thinking of
Can it be the way it was?

Maybe a thief stole your heart"
Here With Me,The Killers,"Wheels are turnin'
I remember when you were mine
Just to reach you
Baby, I'd stand in line
There's another world
We're livin' in tonight
And there's another heart
That's fadin' in the light

Don't want your picture on my cell phone
I want you here with me
Don't want your memories in my head, no
I want you here with me

Spent the summer just layin' out in the sun
Time seems to move so slowly, when you're taking it as it comes
Maybe we were just too young
Your body was tan and your hair was long
You shot me a smile and my cares were gone
Fallin' in love filled my soul with fright
You said, ""Come on, babe, it'll be alright""
I must've been a fool to the bitter end
Now I hold on to hope that I'll have you back again

I'd bargain and I'd fight
But there's another world you're livin' in tonight

Don't want your picture on my cell phone
I want you here with me
I don't want your memory in my head, no
I want you here with me

Well, I saw you in a restaurant the other day
And instead of walkin' towards you, I ran away (ran away)
I keep on waitin' for you
For you to come around
Come around and say

I don't want your picture on my cell phone
I want you here with me
Don't need those memories in my head, no
I want you here with me
Ahhhhh

A Matter Of Time,The Killers,"You're looking for a way out
I can feel it
Come on, show me where it hurts
Maybe I can heal it
Your feelings are your own
Now you keep them under lock and key
You got me driving through the streets
For an answer to the mystery

The willows still weep on Charleston Avenue
Outside that vacant Starlight Motel
I see you laughing with your girlfriends
Not a care in the world, not a burden on your mind
It was a matter of time

There's a panic in this house and it's bound to surface
Just walking through the front door makes me nervous
It's creeping up the floorboards, got me wondering where I stand
I cannot put out the fire, I got a book of matches in my hand

When we first met, headstrong and filled with doubt
Made just enough hustling tables that summer to take you out
I was falling back on forever
Then you told me about your heart
You laid it on the line
Laughing with your girlfriends
Not a care in the world, not a burden on your mind
(You laid it on the line)
It was just a matter, it was a matter of time

We found ourselves a place
We belong in it forever
Ain't that what it's all about?
Make the promise and keep it
Come hell or high water
We'd figure it out
It was the night, it was the moon
It was the green grass in the garden
The victory and the sin
I know you're weary, look at me
Flailing in the corner
Here's the towel
Go on, throw it in

It was a matter of time
Can't you see that it's tearing me up inside?
Look what's laying at our feet
That's the wreckage of broken dreams
And burned out halos
And it's here on our street"
Deadlines And Commitments,The Killers,"That place we all run to
It can come down on you
The expectation can be great
If you should ever tire
Or if you should require
Sudden simple twist of fate

Don't hide away, there's something to be said
For pushing through
We'd never ride on horses that discourage you

If you should fall upon hard times
If you should lose your way
There is a place here in this house
That you can stay

If you should find romance
Go on and take that chance
Before the strategies begin
Deadlines and Commitments
Every morning, in the evening
They can suck you in
Boy, don't I know it

This offer will be standing
All you got to do is call
Don't be afraid to knock on the door

If you should fall upon hard times
If you should lose your way
There is a place here in this house
That you can stay

I'm not talking about deadlines and commitments
Sold out of confusion
There is a place here in this house that you can stay

I'll catch you darling
I'll be waiting up and on your side

Miss Atomic Bomb,The Killers,"You were standing with your girlfriends in the street
Falling back on forever, I wonder what you came to be
I was new in town, the boy with the eager eyes
I never was a quitter, oblivious to schoolgirl's lies
And when I look back on those neon nights
The leather seats, the passage rite
I feel the heat, I see the light

From Miss Atomic Bomb
Making out we got the radio on
You're going to miss me when I'm gone
You're going to miss me when I'm gone

Racing shadows in the moonlight
Through the desert on a hot night
For a second there we'd won
Yeah, we were innocent and young

Cast out of the night
You got a foolish heart
So you took your place but the fall from grace
Was the hardest part
It feels just like a dagger buried deep in your back
You run for cover but you can't escape the second attack
Her soul was innocent, she kissed him and she painted it black
You should have seen your little face, burning for love
Holding on for your life

All that I wanted was a little touch
A little tenderness and truth, I didn't ask for much, no
Talk about being at the wrong place at the wrong time

Miss Atomic Bomb
Making out we've got the radio on
You're going to miss me when I'm gone
You're going to miss me when I'm gone

Racing shadows through the moonlight
Taking chances on a hot night
For a second there we won
We were innocent and young

The dust cloud has settled, and my eyes are clear
But sometimes in dreams of impact I still hear
Miss Atomic Bomb, I'm standing here
Sweat on my skin
And this love that I've cradled
Is wearing thin (Miss Atomic Bomb)
But I'm standing here and you are too late
Your shock-wave whisper has sealed your fate

It feels just like a dagger buried deep in your back
(It's a proving ground)
You run for cover but you can't escape the second attack
(And you turn to chance)
Your soul was innocent
She kissed him and she painted it black (on a loser's game)
You should have seen your little face
Burning for love
(Miss Atomic Bomb)

Holding on for your life
But you can't survive (All that I wanted was a little touch)
When you want it all (A little tenderness and truth, I didn't ask for much)
There's another side (Talk about being at the wrong place at the wrong time)"
The Rising Tide,The Killers,"The streets of persuasion
Are plated with gold
Your heart's in the right place
But you traveled down the wrong road
Like so many before you, the gates open wide
Here come the rising tide

Let's go out tonight
There's a mystery underneath the neon light
Before life and the dream collide
Because the truth's gonna come and cut me open wide
And you can't escape the rising of the tide

Keep up your appearance
You're joining the choir
With everybody singing out glory Hallelujah
The time came for your solo
But there was nowhere to hide
Here come the rising tide

And the company you keep
Where they plan your crucifixion as we speak
So baby, till life and the dream collide
There's going to be a mystery underneath those neon lights

If you can't decipher just who's on your side
You will not escape the rising of the tide

Can you tell me brother
Was I deceived or in denial?
I was there in the back of the room when you testified
With your pitchfork tongue you licked your lips and lied
We're never going to know how hard you cried
When you petitioned and your access was denied
Till the venom in your veins is satisfied
Till you suffocate and swallow down the pride
Where you can't escape, yeah you can't escape
No you can't escape the rising of the tide"
Heart Of A Girl,The Killers,"Looking out my window an angel in robe appeared and nearly pulled me apart
A million miles of freedom
A million miles of road
But I still don't know where to start
She wrote her number down
She gave it to me
They had to scrape me off the floor
In this transient town
Waiters and dealers trying to get their foot in the door
That night I called her, she said

Daddy, daddy, daddy, all my life
I've been trying to find my place in the world
(I said to her)
Baby, baby, babe I got all night
To listen to the heart of a girl

I can see the time dripping down the clock
We've been trying to hear that ancient refrain
It's the one that knows us when our heads are down
It reminds us of the place from where we came
Where we came

Daddy, daddy, daddy, all my life
I've been trying to find my place in the world
(I said to her)
Baby, baby, babe I got all night
To listen to the heart of a girl

What happened here? What is this world?
It's too far from the heart of a girl
A ripple in the water from the drop of a pearl
I'm on the shore waiting for the heart of a girl

Many doors
Knock on one
Standing still, time is raging
Staring down the mouth of 100,000 guns
You're still here, you're still here
I believe that we never have to be alone
Yes I believe it's just around the bend
You can hold it in, or you can scream it on the microphone
There is no end
There is no end

Deep in the night, I feel a presence
Of something that was long ago, told to me
There is a hand guiding the river
The river to wide open sea
And deep in my heart, in any game
On any mountain, no I'm not afraid
Standing on stone, you stand beside me
And honor the plans that were made"
From Here On Out,The Killers,"A little birdie whispered in my ear
You've been cooking up a world of fear
Put your hands in things you shouldn't have known
He was riding in the danger zone

Well you had us all fooled, with your quarterback smile
And your crocodile tears, there for a while
My paradigm shifted and man you're making me shout

Hey, from here on out
Friends are gonna be hard to come by
Left us wondering what it all was about
He had it easy then he chose the hard way
Walk that lonely road in a shadow of a doubt
From here on out

Should our paths ever decide to cross
You may wonder what the trouble costs
That don't matter now, life goes on
Hallelujah, the troubles' gone

No sense in holding purpose and it's better to forgive
These are things that I must learn, to practice while I live
And my paradigm shifted, man you're making me shout

Hey, from here from out
Friends are gonna be hard to come by
Left us wonderin' what it all was about
He had it easy, man he chose the hard way
Walk that old, lonely road in the shadow of a doubt

Hey, from here on out
Let the bugle blow a song of peace time
Left us wonderin' what it all was about
You may deny it but you carry it with you
Down that old lonely road in the shadow of a doubt
Yeah, from here on out"
Be Still,The Killers,"Be still
Go on to bed
Nobody knows what lies ahead
Life is short to say the least
We're in the belly of the beast
Be still, wild and young
Long may your innocence reign
Like shells on a shore
May your limits be unknown
May your efforts be your own
If you ever feel you can't take it anymore

Don't break character
You've got a lot of heart
Is this real or just a dream
Rise up like the sun
Labor till the work is done

Be still
One day you'll lead
Fearlessness on your sleeve
When you come back, tell me what did you see
Was there something out there for me
Be still
Close your eyes
Soon enough, you'll be on your own, steady and straight
And if they drag you through the mud
It doesn't change what's in your blood
Over rock, over chain, over trap, over plane
When they knock you down

Don't break character
You've got a lot of heart
Is this real or just a dream
Be still, be still
Be still, be still

Over rock and chain
Over sunset plane
Over trap and snare
When you're in too deep
In your wildest dreams
In your made up schemes
When they knock you down
When they knock you down

Don't break character
You've got so much heart
Is this real or just a dream, oh
Rise up like the sun
And labor till the work is done
Rise up like the sun
And labor till the work is done
Rise up like the sun
And labor till the work is done"
Battle Born,The Killers,"You lost faith in the human spirit
You walk around like a ghost
And your star-spangled heart
Took a train for the coast
And when you shine, you're a hilltop mansion
So how'd you lose the light?
Was it blown by the wind
In the still of the night?

You're up against the wall

Up against the wall
There's something dying on the street
When they knock you down
You're gonna to get back on your feet
('Cause you can't stop now)

I always saw you as a kind of keeper
A mother to a child
But your boys have grown soft
And your girls have gone wild
From the Blue Ridge to the Black Hills
To the Redwood sky
The season may pass
But the dream doesn't die

Now don't you drop the ball

Up against the wall
There's something dying on the street
When they knock you down
You're gonna to get back on your feet
(But you can't stop now)

And when they break your heart
And when they cause your soul to mourn
Remember what I said
""Boy, you was battle born""
(But you can't stop now)

You was battle born

And when the night falls on the land
Are you haunted by the sound?
It's going to take more than a hand
To turn this thing around
Won't you lean it on me?
Rescue, set me free

You're up against the wall (up against the wall)

Carry Me Home,The Killers,"Let me out
Don't tell me everything
Started out like any other day
Must have gave the wrong impression
Don't you understand where I belong?
I'm not the one
Stand again
They say nothing comes for free
And that's the truth, I've been living in a fantasy
Slip and slide
A head trip heaven
Self-denial such a wonderful and powerful thing
Well I'm not the one

The morning dove sings with two broken wings
Carry me home
I'm not afraid
The stars in my eyes were shimmering lights
Carry me home
Don't let me fade away

Stop the press
The kid's light is growing dim
It took a month long slide
Then the world came caving in
When you self-destruct
You wind up looking for a glimmer of hope
But the writing's on the wall
I'm not the one

The morning dove sings with two broken wings
Carry me home
I'm not afraid
The stars in my eyes were shimmering lights
Carry me home
Don't let me fade away

Just how thick is your skin?
Just how sharp are your teeth?
Oh, you've got a lot to learn
Is there somewhere else I can win?
Is there something else to start over again?
From the summit's edge, to the cutting room floor
I will be afraid no more (no more)

The morning dove sings with two broken wings
Carry me home
I'm not afraid
The stars in my eyes were shimmering lights
Carry me home
Don't let me fade
Carry me home
Carry me"
Prize Fighter,The Killers,"She's a pillar by the day, a fire by night
She's a famous architect, like Frank Lloyd Wright
When it comes to tight rope walking
She's world-renowned

Her elegance and charm are worthy of praise
And I heard she used to throw, for The Oakland A's
She works 268 hours a week, I've yet to meet her match

A marvel of modern science
She's a natural-born pioneer
I can't make up my mind
Should I put her on display, or hide her?

I'm going to be her prize fighter
I know that she's out of my league
I'm going to be her prize fighter
My uniform has been decreed

She's a daughter of the gods, got a lot of clout
If she's ever in a bind, I'll get her out
And sometimes I have these nightmares, in the middle of the day
Where a hay-making gypsy just steals her away

There is no doubt about it
(No doubt about it)
I'm a slave to her shade of love
(No doubt about it)
One day Her Majesty the Queen, unprovoked and unforeseen
She's going to fly her over to England, put that sword on her shoulder, and knight her

I'm going to be her prize fighter
No label's going to change where she's from
I'm going to be her prize fighter
And I'm dancing to the beat of her drum

She's always on my side, rich or poor
She's with me all the way, to The Golden Door
My lioness, my pièce de résistance
My only way

I'm going to drive me an El Dorado
The color of her Monterey eyes
With twin bullet tail lights
And plates that read desire

I'm going to be her prize fighter
Though the weather may be foul
I'm going to be her prize fighter
Though the wind and the wolves may howl

Through the sunshine and through the rain
I'm going to be her prize fighter
Over and over again"
A Great Big Sled,"The Killers, Toni Halliday","This snowman is shaping up to be an eight
But not out of ten
The robots awake to find that they've been taped down
Wondering when
They'll break through these chains
But little boys have action toys for brains
I'm living proof it can last a long time

Now the girls off the street are innocent and sweet
When they're all in bed
They got their make-up and dreams of wonderland
Sprinkled inside their heads
And soon they will change
But tonight, Hollywood has never seemed so strange
Now mothers pray it'll last a long time

I want to roll around like a kid in the snow
I want to relearn what I already know
Just let me take flight, dressed in red
Through the night, on a great big sled

I want to wish you Merry Christmas
Ho, ho, ho

Now the boys are all grown up
And they're working their fingers to the bone
They go around chasing them girls on the weekend
You know they still can't be alone
And I've been racking my brain
With thoughts of peace and love
How on earth did we get so mixed up?
I pray to God it don't last a long time

I want to roll around like a kid in the snow
I want to relearn what I already know
Just let me take flight, dressed in red
Through the night, on a great big sled

There's something on the roof
I wonder what this night will bring

"Joseph, Better You Than Me","The Killers, Elton John, Neil Tennant","Well your eyes just haven't been the same, Joseph
Are you bad at dealing with the fame, Joseph?
There's a pale moonshine above you
Do you see both sides? Do they shove you around?

Is the touchstone forcing you to hide, Joseph?
Are the rumors eating you alive, Joseph?
When the holy night is upon you
Will you do what's right? The position is yours

From the temple walls to the New York night
Our decisions rest on a child
When she took her stand, did she hold your hand?
Will your faith stand still or run away?
Run away

When they've driven you so far
That you think you're gonna drop
Do you wish you were back there
At the carpenter shop?

With the plane and the lathe
The work never drove you mad
You're a maker, a creator
Not just somebody's dad

From the temple walls to the New York night
Our decisions rest on a man
When I take the stand, will he hold my hand?
Will my faith stand still or run away?
(Run away)

And the desert, it's a hell of a place to find heaven
Forty years lost in the wilderness, looking for God
And you climb to the top of the mountain
Looking down on the city where you were born

¡Happy Birthday Guadalupe!,"The Killers, Wild Light, Mariachi El Bronx","Well I woke up Christmas morning and what did I see?
I saw a lovely señorita looking back at me
Named Guadalupe with big brown eyes
Boy what did you do this time?

Made my excuses and a beeline for the bedroom door
She was begging and a-pleading screaming ""Por favor
Mi cumpleaños stay with me
Baby it's cold outside""

We are living in a difficult time
We've been walking down a difficult line
Put your feet up baby it's Christmas time
Cumpleaños feliz
Happy Birthday Guadalupe

(Our time will come)
(We both hold on)

She gave me coffee and tortillas to console my head
Prepared the slippers on my feet before she made our bed
And blew the candles from her favorite cake
And we kissed beneath the mistletoe

I pulled her body close to mine and I had just one chance
I whispered ""Baby will you marry me for just one dance?""
Infatuation the things you say
I got scared and I left that night

We are living in a difficult time
We've been walking down a difficult line
Put your feet up baby it's Christmas time
Cumpleaños feliz
Happy Birthday Guadalupe

(Our time will come)
(We both hold on)

Deck the halls with rosaries
Wish upon a Christmas tree
Silent night please come to me
Bearing gifts from my... my Mexican angel

At night I wake up cold and lonely bursting at the seams
She haunts the early morning hours of December dreams
My Guadalupe with big brown eyes
I wanna break the spell tonight

'Cause we are living in a difficult time
We've been walking down a difficult line
Put your feet up baby it's Christmas time

Show me the way, oh God

Silent night for a change
A brand new year coming up ahead
You know it's been so long since I rang one in
I close my eyes, think about the path I took
Just when I think these times have gotten the best of me

I can see my mother in the kitchen, my father on the floor
Watching television, ""It's A Wonderful Life""
Cinnamon candles burning, snowball fights outside
Smile below each nose and above each chin
Stomp my boots before I go back in

I wasted my wishes on Saturday nights
Boy, what I would give for just one more
I'd soften my heart, shock the world
Do you hear my voice?
Do you know my name?
Light my way, lift my head, light my way

I can see my mother in the kitchen, my father on the floor
Watching television, ""It's A Wonderful Life""
Cinnamon candles burning, snowball fights outside
Smile below each nose and above each chin
Stomp my boots before I go back in

Family all together, presents piled high
Frost on all the windows, what a wonderful night
Cinnamon candles burning, snowball fights outside
Smile below each nose and above each chin

So happy they found me
Love was all around me
Stomp my boots before I go back in"
The Cowboys' Christmas Ball,The Killers,"Way out in Old Nevada, where the Truckee's waters flow
Where the cattle are ""a-browsing"" and the Spanish ponies grow
Where the Northers ""come a-whistling"" from beyond the Neutral Strip
And the prairie dogs are sneezing, as if they had ""The Grip""
Where the coyotes come a-howling around the ranches after dark
And the bluebirds are a-singing to the lovely ""meadow lark""
Where the bighorns are a-grazing and the lonely plovers call —
It was there that I attended ""The Cowboys' Christmas Ball""
(Whoo!)

The boys had left the ranches and come to town in piles
The ladies — ""kind of scattering"" — had gathered in for miles
The room was togged out gorgeous – with mistletoe and shawls
And candles flickered frescoes, around the airy walls
The women folk looked lovely – the boys looked kinda treed
Till the leader got to yelling: ""Hey, fellers, let's stampede!""
And the music started sighing, and availing through the hall
As a kind of introduction to ""The Cowboys Christmas Ball""

Their leader was a feller that came from Swenson's ranch
They called him ""Windy Billy,"" from ""little Dead man's Branch""
His rig was ""kinda careless,"" big spurs and high-heeled boots
He had the reputation that come when ""a fellers shoots""
His voice was like a bugle upon a mountainous height
His feet were animated an' a mighty, moving sight
When he commenced to hollering, ""Now, fellers stake your pen!""
""Lock horns with all them heifers, and Russel them like men
""Salute yer lovely critters; now swing and let them go
""Climb the grape vine around them — all hands do-ce-do!
""You Mavericks, join the round-up – Just skip her waterfall""
Huh! It was getting happy, The Cowboys Christmas Ball

Don't tell me about cotillions, or Germans, no sirree!
That whirl at Carson City just takes the cake with me
I'm sick of lazy shuffling's, of them I've had my fill
Just Give me a frontier break-down, backed up by Wild Old Bill

Mc Allister isn't nowhere, when Windy leads the show
I've seen them both in harness, and so I sorta know
Oh, Bill, I shall not forget you, and I'll oftentimes recall
That lively gaited soiree — ""The Cowboys Christmas Ball""

Christmas In L.A.,"The Killers, Dawes","Woke up to sun streaming in my room
Warm beachfront palm December afternoon
You close your eyes
Another year blows by
Somewhere in the wind
Just another life

My parents sent a Christmas card and tennis shoes
""We understand you're staying
And we're proud of you""
There's a well-rehearsed disinterest in the atmosphere
I don't know if that's what this town gave me
Or if it led me here

And I played so many parts
I don't know which one's really me
Don't know if I can take

Another Christmas in L.A
Another pitcher of Sangria
In an empty beach café
Another Christmas in L.A
Hold me tighter Carmelita
I don't know how long I can stay

Left a girl behind in my old man's truck
Sometimes I wonder where she ended up
Maybe she got married, had a couple of kids
Who do you think you're fooling man?
Of course she did

I'm walking in Dan Tana's bar
Try and talk with Harry Dean
I don't know if I can take

Another Christmas in L.A
Another casting call on Thursday
For a job that doesn't pay
Another Christmas in L.A
Another burnout in a tank top
Who seems to bask in his decay
A fat protagonist in flip flops
With an extensive resume
From Echo Park to Catalina

Dreaming of a white Christmas
The one I used to know
Tree tops glisten, children listen
To sleigh bells in the snow"
Joel The Lump Of Coal,"The Killers, Jimmy Kimmel","Some time ago, at Santa's place
Up in the old North Pole
There lived a lump of anthracite
Whose parents called him Joel

Joel, Joel, the lump of coal
Happy as a lump can be
He just wants to keep Santa warm
And make the elves cozy

But Santa Claus had other plans
For Joel one fateful day
""Joel, you're just the lump I need
Come join me on my sleigh""

Joel, Joel, the lump of coal
Heart leapt up with joy
""I'll soon be Santa's present to
A lucky girl or boy

We'll laugh and play together
And we'll hold each other tight
Snuggle under clean white sheets
When we go to sleep at night""

Then Santa's elves all laughed at Joel
""You're in for a surprise
You're not a special Christmas gift
You're just a booby prize

What kid would ever want you?
You're filthy as can be
Now you have to go and live
With one who's been naughty""

""But I make heat,"" poor Joel cried
""And electricity""
""You pollute the air
With CO2 and mercury""

Joel, Joel, the lump of coal
Fell down upon his knees
""I don't wanna live with a naughty kid
Don't make me, Santa, please""

But Santa laughed his jolly laugh
""Ho, ho, you stupid lump
You're just the thing to teach this brat
That Santa ain't no chump""

So off they flew and, before he knew
Joel was in a sack
He cried and yelled to Santa Claus
""Why don't we just go back?""

And then came Christmas morning
And, much to Joel's surprise (Much to Joel's surprise)
He saw a boy with the saddest face
And tears were in his eyes (Tears were in his eyes)

He picked Joel up and held him
And said ""You can be my friend (Hey man, let's be friends)
I would've liked some presents but
You're what Santa chose to send (Santa chose to send)

It's true, I've been a naughty boy
And maybe that's a sin (Maybe that's a sin)
If this is how Santa treats the kids
I'm just glad that I'm not him""

Joel, Joel, the lump of coal
Knew what he must do
He said ""Now I know the reason why
I got sent to you

Cause when a person hurts inside
It turns him hard and cruel
But I know how to make your pain
Into a precious jewel

So take me in your hand, young man
And squeeze with all your might
Let's turn your pain and anger
Into something that shines bright""

And we know it wasn't easy
You've been after me a long while
A pathological display
Now take a moment to imagine
My dismay
When I heard you had a heart change
I was skeptical at first
'Til you've seen it for yourself
I guess you just expect the worst

Crooked nose and bloodshot eyes
Iron will for telling lies
Cheap sick smile and one inch fuse
You hurt me Santa and I'm confused

Pretty girls, Christmas lights
Mistletoe, holy nights
Don't it sound like heaven on a cloud?

Yeah, I hear you on the bomb shell
I was taken back myself
And I'd like to make it alright
So I called the elves
We hashed up a little guess what
Your nice status was renewed
Just tell Santa what you want
I'm gonna make your dreams come true

Red Porsche 944 like Jake
In ""Sixteen Candles"" for goodness sake
And a couple more you might have missed
Like a shiny Rolex on my wrist and

Pretty girls, Christmas lights
Mistletoe, holy nights
Don't it sound like heaven on a cloud?

Too many people in black robes posing as judges
They should turn that mirror around
Too many people weighed down by frivolous grudges
When will we look to leave the past behind?

You know it's nice to see you wrapped up
See how far you've come
There's something to be said for being present
Not just getting one
So pass the gravy and tap your toes
And don't mind Ol' Jack Frost nipping at your nose

A crooked nose and bloodshot eyes
Iron will for telling lies
If you've got squabble in your skin
Just take that turkey and trade it in for

Pretty girls, Christmas lights
Mistletoe, holy nights

All I ever really wanted was
Pretty girls, Christmas lights
Mistletoe, holy nights
Don't it sound like heaven on a cloud?
Don't it sound like heaven on a cloud?"
I'll Be Home For Christmas,"The Killers, Ned Humphrey Hansen","""My mother and father spent most of their lives in Henderson, Nevada. The small, dusty sidecar of Las Vegas. Henderson was just like any other town in America, only with slot machines in the laundromat. It was 1990, and Vegas was boomin', baby! But Jeanie and Terry weren't gamblers or dealers or mafiosos or lounge singers. They were just two normal people trying to keep up with the pack in a one-hundred-and-sixteen-degree rat race. And those rats; they'd nibbled long enough. Now, I don't know what a mosey looks like, but they packed up their house and their clothes and their me, and they moseyed on outta dodge. Of course, I had my gripes about leavin'. I mean, I had a life in Henderson. Kenny and Kevin Hebner were just two houses up. The desert fort behind my house wasn't gonna defend itself. But what could I do? I was nine. A nine-year-old can't just stage a sit-in while the rest of the family checks out. This wasn't a Home Alone movie, so... I went where the sweet'n'sour chicken was cooked, and the ice-cold, caffeine-free Coke was just a fridge away. And just like that, from sagebrush, slot machines and Elvis to Footloose, Onion Days and Jewel. She was born there, after all. This place called Payson, Utah. God's country. Population: blink, and you'll miss it. Dad got a job in the produce department at the Smith's Food King, which was fitting since he managed to produce six kids: April, Shelley, Amy, Stephanie and my brother Shane were the other five. I was in fourth grade at the time, an age when boys start thinking more like men. And there wasn't a dull moment: I'd had my first fight, my first crush, my first rodeo, but most importantly my first white Christmas. I did my best to fit in, and I did as my teachers said, but that year one teacher stood out from the rest. He didn't just stand out from the rest; he sung out. His name was Mr. Hansen. And on a frosty December morning, he explained to us the story of the old standard ""I'll Be Home For Christmas"". A tale of a World War II soldier stationed overseas, writing a letter to his family about the return that he may never make. I saw it struck deep in him. Now, it would be easy to describe Mr. Hansen as brave. After all, this was a man who himself had served his country during the Korean war. But getting up in front of twenty five nine-year-olds and singing a cappella? That's a whole other kind of bravery altogether. The other kids were looking for the nearest escape: they couldn't bear the embarrassment. But not me. I was wrapped up in it. I couldn't help myself. I knew I was experiencing something different from the others, but I was uplifted so it didn't matter. I felt the isolation of war. I felt the power of a song, and that's the kind of thing that sticks with you. You don't let it go. And so, for this here Christmas song, I have a friend I brought along. He's eighty six, but sounds like twenty, and though the other kids might find it funny, he'd like to sing his song for you, and if he doesn't mind I might join in too.""

I'll be home for Christmas
You can count on me
Please have snow and mistletoe
And presents on the tree

Oh Christmas eve will find me
Where the love light gleams
I'll be home for Christmas
If only in my dreams

I'll be home for Christmas
You can count on me
Please have snow and mistletoe
And presents on the tree

Oh Christmas eve will find me
Where the love light gleams
I'll be home for Christmas
If only in my dreams
If only in my dreams"

Rut,The Killers,"Don't give up on me
'Cause I'm just in a rut
I'm climbing but the walls keep stacking up

Can't keep my mind off of every little wrong
I see the mouths are open, but I can't hear the song
I've done my best to fill 'em, but the cracks are starting to spread
Hey I won't blame you baby, go on turn your head

But don't give up on me
'Cause I'm just in a rut
I'm climbing but the walls keep stacking up

I can't keep pretending this next stop isn't mine
The truth is on the table, someone's gotta sign
I've done my best defending, but the punches are starting to land
I'm sliding into something you won't understand

Don't give up on me
'Cause I'm just in a rut
I'm climbing but the walls keep stacking up

But don't give up on me
'Cause I'm just in a rut
I'm climbing but the walls keep stacking up

So I'm handing you a memory
I hope you understand
That steadily reminds you of who I really am

This city's always breathing, I wish that it would die
The kickbacks and the bachelors, the fever for the velvet rope
The money from my mother's men
I'm not like her, you're not like them

I'll climb and I'll climb, I'll climb and I'll climb, I'll climb and I'll climb
I'll climb and I'll climb, I'll climb and I'll climb, I'll climb and I'll climb
I'll climb and I'll climb, I'll climb and I'll climb, I'll climb and I'll climb

Life To Come,The Killers,"I didn't see this comin', I admit it
But if you think I'll buckle, forget it
I told you that I'd be the one
I'll be there in the life to come

You think I lost my vision but I didn't
It sounds like heaven, but it isn't
Through fields of amber we will run
Somewhere in the life to come

This is not a shake down
Let go of the blame
Have a little faith in me, girl
Just dropkick the shame
Uncover your face, girl
Let go of the blame
Have a little faith in me
Just drop kick the shame

If you call my name
I will run whether or not it's tonight
Or the life to come

I know sometimes you think that I regret it
But I don't remember stumblin' when I said it
I told you that I'd be the one
I was talkin 'bout the life to come

Run For Cover,The Killers,"What have you gathered to report to your progenitors?
Are your excuses any better than your senator's?
He held a conference and his wife was standing by his side
He did her dirty but no-one died

I saw Sonny Liston on the street last night
Black-fisted and strong singing Redemption Song
He motioned me to the sky
I heard heaven and thunder cry

Run for cover
Run while you can, baby, don't look back
You gotta run for cover
Don't be afraid of the fear, that's a played out trap, man
You know you're not the only one
And don't look back, just run for cover

What are you waiting for, a kiss or an apology?
You think by now you'd have an A in toxicology
It's hard to pack the car when all you do is shame us
It's even harder when the dirtbag's famous

I saw my mother on the street last night
All pretty and strong, singing 'the road is long'
I said 'Momma I know you've tried'
But she fell on her knees and cried

Run for cover
Run while you can, baby, don't look back
You gotta run for cover
Don't be afraid of the fear, that's a played out trap, man
I know you're not the only one
And don't look back, just run for cover

And there was nothing she wouldn't give
Just to trust him with her nightmares, with her dreams
She's running, she's running
Just to trust him
He got a big smile, he's fake news
Just run for cover, you've got nothing left to lose

Run for cover
Run while you can, baby, don't look back
You gotta run for cover
Don't be afraid of the fear, that's a played out trap, man
You know you're not the only one
And don't look back, just run for cover

Run

Tyson vs Douglas,The Killers,"Lookin' out the window, out on the street
I don't know what happened, I'm out on my feet
I hear my mother calling my name
I still come running, but I ain't the same

You can change the channel
Take the phone off the hook
Avoid the headlines
But you'll never grow up, baby, if you don't look

When I saw him go down
Felt like somebody lied
I had to hold my breath 'til the coast was clear
When I saw him go down
Felt like somebody lied
I had to close my eyes just to stop the tears

You're used to winning, how did it feel?
Could you hear the screaming? It was unreal
What did they pay you, what did it cost?
How long did it take you to know that you lost?

You can hit the showers
Fill the place up with steam
Close the curtains
But when you woke up, man it wasn't no dream

When I saw him go down
Felt like somebody lied
I had to hold my breath 'til the coast was clear
When I saw him go down
Felt like somebody lied
I had to close my eyes, close my eyes
Just to stop the tears

Lookin' out the window out on the street
My boy and his mother
And I think of me
Feelin' the slip again
Don't wanna fall
You said it was nothing, but maybe you're wrong

'Cause when I saw him go down
Felt like somebody lied
I had to hold my breath 'til the coast was clear
When I saw him go down
Felt like somebody lied
I had to close my eyes just to stop the tears

(Just to stop the tears)

Some Kind Of Love,The Killers,"You got the will of a wild

On a long distance haul
You got the grace of a storm
In the desert

Out Of My Mind,The Killers,"We're building up a kingdom
We pray it never falls
I can lose my temper
You can put up walls
And I hate when it gets serious
It's like we're going blind
Take the needle off the record
I can't stand another chorus
About Juliet's control
Over mystified mankind

But I can't get you out of mind
To get you out of my bed
To get you out of my heart
And my head
(Oh, we're falling)
(Oh, we're falling)

I stormed the gates of Graceland
To make you realize
Went back to back with Springsteen
You turned and rolled your eyes
So I told you about McCartney
And that's a heavy name to drop
You say you don't need confirmation
But I don't know if I can stop

Cause I can't get you out of my mind
To get you out of my bed
To get you out of my heart
And my head
(Oh, we're falling)

Oh we're falling
Oh we're falling
Oh we're falling

The Calling,The Killers,"And it came to pass, as Jesus sat at meat in the house, behold, many publicans and sinners came and sat down with him and his disciples. And when the Pharisees saw this, they said unto his disciples, ""Why eateth your Master with publicans and senators?"" But when Jesus heard that, he said unto them, ""They that be whole need not a physician, but they that are sick.""

I walked into town with a message for my old man
I've got the last two chapters of Matthew in my hand
Steve painting houses while Bobby went and gone insane
They buried my sister but daddy he stayed the same

Follow the sun out of the night
Brother, just lean into the light
You wanna be sure, I'll give you sight
Brother, just lean into the light

His hands still shake when the ponies break out on the track
(Here comes the calling)
His feet still quick when they say they want their money back (Here comes the calling)
But Daddy did you think that you could outrun the Holy Ghost? (Here comes the calling)
Lie, cheat, steal, hope they fix it all up in post

The book will be open
In front of the judge
Unquenchable fire
Or keys to the kingdom

Follow the sun out of the night
Brother, just lean into the light
(Just lean into the light)
You wanna be sure, I'll give you sight
Brother, just lean into the light
(Just lean into the light)
The road to the kingdom's burnin' bright
Brother, just lean into the light

You heard that the master was traveling through
But what would you do if he walked in the room?
Make for the left, or break for the right?
Brother, just lean in
Brother, just lean into the light

Follow the sun out of the night
Brother, just lean into the light
(Just lean into the light)
You wanna be sure, I'll give you sight
Brother, just lean into the light
(Just lean into the light)
The road to the kingdom's burnin' bright
Brother, just lean into the light

Have All The Songs Been Written?,The Killers,"Have all the songs been written?
Have all the truths been told?

Has every heart gone blue?
Have all the songs been written?

I just need one more

Have all the songs been written?
Have all your needs been met?
Have all these years been worth it
Or am I the great regret?

Has every ship gone sailing?
Has every heart gone blue?
Have all the songs been written?
Oh, I just need one to get through to you
I just need one more to get through to you

When the ship is back in the harbor

My Own Soul’s Warning,The Killers,"I tried going against my own soul's warning
But in the end, something just didn't feel right
Oh, I tried diving even though the sky was storming
I just wanted to get back to where you are

If you could see through the banner of the sun
Into eternity's eyes, like a vision reaching down to you
Would you turn away?
What if it knew you by your name?
What kind of words would cut through the clutter of the whirlwind of these days?

I tried going against my own soul's warning
And in the end, something just didn't feel right
Oh, I tried diving, even though the sky was storming
Thunderheads were forming

But then I thought I could fly
And when I hit the ground
It made a messed up sound
And it kept on rattling through my days
And cutting up my nights
Like a goddamn knife
And it got me thinking, no matter how far
I just wanted to get back to where you are

I tried going against my own soul's warning
And in the end, something just didn't feel right
Oh, I tried running from the memory and the mourning
But the penalty kept on pouring

It made a messed up sound
And it kept on rattling through my days
And cutting up my nights

Blowback,The Killers,"She's reaching for her backpack

She can go straight from zero
To the Fourth of July

The lightning field of love
I didn't want to wake up
I just wanted to run my fastest and stand beside you in
The lightning field

Take the car out for a drive
Run my fastest and stand beside you in

Name and raise again, press your face to mine
Run my fastest and name and raise again

Over heels again, tell you everything

All the things that I'd do different if I just had the chance
Don't beat yourself up, you laid good ground
Look at 'em all from scratch 'til sundown
You put the work in and then some
Where is all this coming from?

Press your face to mine, name and raise again
Take the car out for a drive
Take me with you to the other side
Run my fastest and stand beside you in
The lightning field of love
Name and raise again, press your face to mine
Run my fastest and name and raise again
Give my name again, speak your name again
Bring myself to just tell you everything, tell you everything
Everything"
Fire In Bone,The Killers,"(Fire in bone)
Fire in bone
I felt fire in bone
Fire in bone
I felt fire in bone
Fire in bone

I felt cast out
I felt eighty-sixed
I felt darkness
But I felt fire in bone
I felt no good
I felt lowdown
And I felt alone
I felt unknown

I felt fire in bone
I felt fire in bone
Wrongly accused and disowned
I felt fire in bone

I felt big time
I felt major league
I felt weird sin
I felt fire in bone
I felt ripped off
Run down, wrung out
Empty, unseen
And preyed upon
I felt fire in bone
I felt fire in bone

When I came back empty-handed
You were waiting in the road
And you fell on my neck
And you took me back home
After all that I took from you
After all that I put you through
Here I am

I felt fire in bone
I felt washed up
I felt tempest-tossed and seasick
But I felt fire in bone
I felt mislead
I felt chained up, unclean, unknown
I felt unknown

I felt fire in bone
I felt fire in bone

And they say no one's gonna save you
You gotta make it on your own
But I called from the dark
And you picked up the phone
On my back in the raging blue
I looked up, and you cut right through

And when I came back empty-handed
You met me in the road
And you fell on my neck
And you took me back home
After all that I took from you
After all that I put you through
Here I am

(Here I am)

Running Towards A Place,The Killers,"Give me the eyes that I may see
The good in my people and the trouble in me
Give me the hands that I may lift
The weight of another who's starting to drift

And if we're running towards a place
Where we'll walk as one
Will the hardness of this life
Be overcome?
If I lay with you in love
Will you meet me there?
And shake the lightning from the locks
Of your unbound hair
Can two become one?

Give me a song that I may sing
That cuts like a canyon and rides on a wing
And give a heart that I may stand
For what I believe in

And if we're running towards a place
Where we'll walk as one
Will the hardness of this life
Be overcome?
If I walk the wild blue
Will you meet me there?
And shake the lightning from the locks
Of your unbound hair
Can two become one?

Can you see the world
In a grain of sand?
Can you find heaven in a wildflower
Hold it in the palm of your hand?
The moment we met
Burst like a star
Onto the canvas of the skyline, purple and gold
We're in this together, I ain't never letting go

Because we're running towards a place
Where we'll walk as one
And the sadness of this life
Will be overcome
If I lay with you in love
Will you meet me there?
And shake the lightning from the locks
Of your unbound hair"

Crawling back to your arms
Stay, stay
From your mouth to my heart
Stay, stay

Stay, stay

Don't talk to me about forgiveness
My God, just look who's back in business
That weight that dragged you down, it has been made light
And I'm at the top of my lungs
'Cause big love cannot be understated
Don't push, control is overrated
I know that if we stick together

Wipe the dust from my eye
Wash my feet with your tears

We let go of what holds
Our hearts in the cold

When The Dreams Run Dry,The Killers,"Can't hear myself think through the crashing of the rain
I'm passing judgement in the fast lane
And smoothing out a rough stone
Guess it comes with age
You start to wonder about the time theft
How much of it you got left
Comes in with the age now

But when the dreams run dry
I will be where I always was
Standing at your side
Letting go of the reins
We're all going to die

When they're closing up the door
Nobody wishing that they worked more
Don't bother with your suitcase
We'll beat the birds down to Acapulco Bay
Or Honolulu on hearsay, running at our own pace
And I'll be on your side when the dreams run dry

When the dreams run dry
I will be where I always was
Standing at your side
Letting go of the reins

Reach for the summit
Of an ancient design
On the verge of eternal
On the heels of divine
If you stumble and fall (If you stumble and fall)
If the way can't be found (If the way can't be found)

We'll just follow the moon to the stars, to the sun, to the ground
And around and around and around
In the light, in the heat, through the folds and the bends
And again and again and again
To the moon, to the stars, to the sun, to the ground
And around and around and around
In the light, in the heat, through the folds and the bends
And again and again and again"
Imploding The Mirage,The Killers,"I was a timid Rockwellian boy
She was tattooed and ready to deploy
Gave me reservation and the like
But she could be the dangerous type
But I threw caution 'cause something about that yin and the yang
Was pushing my boundaries out beyond my imagining

While you were out there, chewing on fat for probable cause
I let go
While you were out there weighing odds
I was imploding the mirage
While you were out there looking like that
Struck my name from the camouflage
I wasn't lost in the collage
I was imploding the mirage
I was imploding the mirage

I had to do it, I had no other choice
You've got to listen to the inside voice
A bullet train will get you there fast
But it won't guarantee a long last
Sometimes it takes a little bit of courage and doubt
To push your boundaries out beyond your imagining

While you were out there, chewing on fat for probable cause
I let go
While you were out there weighing odds
I was imploding the mirage
While you were out there looking like that
Struck my name from the camouflage
I wasn't lost in the collage
I was imploding the mirage
I was imploding the mirage

I was spellbound by the show
The matchless power of the glow
I was bound by golden shackles, getting by
She tripped the breaker, blew the fuse
Doesn't need no pair of shoes
Her wings have come, and she's ready for the sky

While you were out there, chewing on fat for probable cause
I let go
While you were out there weighing odds
I was imploding the mirage
While you were out there looking like that
I walked right out of the camouflage
I wasn't locked in no collage
I was imploding the mirage
I was imploding the mirage"

Sometimes you're the river
And sometimes you're the sea

But you'll be fine
Just remember where you come from
How you got the song
Then you'll always get it right, more than you get it wrong

When it does wonders for your health
And all you've got to do is take it slow
Time starts burning at both ends
And pocket dialing famous friends
And acting like there's somewhere else to go

Really in for it - ain't I?
Nearly died on the fence

Double checking junk to see where the apologies went
The best thing that I had since records began
I would do anything, take anything, I'm so Machiavellian
It's gonna eat me up
It's gonna eat me up

Don't know what I'll do now my luck is all spent
And I wish I had you here, tell me what it all meant
To get to grips
Serenading the apocalypse

Maybe we should keep on dancing
I feel like something good is gonna happen
Don't care if I'm the last one standing

Even if the song's all gone and it's the end of the world
No, nothing's gonna stop us, gonna stop us now
So we should keep on dancing
Maybe we should keep on dancing on and on

I feel like something good is gonna happen
Don't care if I'm the last one standing"
Primitive Man,The Vaccines,"Even when you get hurt
You don't ever feel pain
You're committed to a good time
All I do is I complain
I wanna feel better
As soon as I can
And I want you of course
But it just never goes to plan

There is gold in the mouth of the silvery sky
With a head full of ice and a drink in its eye

As I vomit - your primitive man
I promise you - I'm changing, I am
And my love flickers but it remains
I'm at your wedding now - you're not taking my name

I don't wanna go down
I don't wanna decline
Hey - no worries if we do though
All my favourite people die
I wanna get better
As soon as I can
And you know me of course
I just don't know who I am

There is gold in the mouth of the silvery sky
With a head full of dread and a drink in its eye

As I vomit - your primitive man
I promise you - I'm changing, I am
And my love flickers but it remains
I'm at your wedding now - you're not taking my name

As I vomit - your primitive man
I promise you - I'm changing, I am
And my love flickers but it remains
I'm at your wedding now - still don't know why I came"
Sunkissed,The Vaccines,"You said, ""Suck my blood out your middle finger.""
Hearts of glass, start to give you splinters
Act like I remind you of the winter
Dammit - you're so cold

Talk that way, it's like you got a death wish
If you died, we'd all just call you selfish
Get so low but like it when you're devilish
Don't I - I was sold

We were lying on the grass in reality
We were surfing down a wave of anxiety
We were hiding from the air filling up our lungs
As the sunkissed - kissed us with tongues
The wind ran through our forever hair
With its hands pressed up against us almost everywhere
And our skin kept getting hotter as we came undone
We were sunkissed - sunkissed with tongues

We were so in love, we booked into the Hilton
Grew my beard to look like Dennis Wilson
Stayed six weeks, the world would never listen
Honey - (What a blast)
Tangled up somewhere in the bedsheets
Ate my words and I gave you the best seats
Went so fast, the time was like an athlete
Funny - never lasts

I saw the truth as it came into view, that I'd only seen from afar
We're sorry sir but if you're not a guest then we can't let you drink at the bar

We were lying on the grass in reality
We were surfing down a wave of anxiety
We were hiding from the air filling up our lungs
As the sunkissed - kissed us with tongues
The wind ran through our forever hair
With its hands pressed up against us almost everywhere
And our skin kept getting hotter as we came undone
We were sunkissed - sunkissed with tongues

And I fell asleep on you
With the man who fell to earth
Still an hour from the end
You began to feel afraid
But you weren't allowed to smoke
So you held me like cement"
Another Nightmare,The Vaccines,"You announced to the stadium that
You knew that you were leaving and you'd never come back
Even for love
It wasn't enough
And now you're living by whatever you've read
If you wanted to escape then you should have just said
""Go to Rome for the week""
'Cause you never went there with me

I was trying to smile
But got blood on the tiles
It was taken away with the evidence
I thought I was awake
Must have been a mistake
Now you've run out of patience

I don't wanna wait a year to feel better
Taking everything to forget ya
Living in echoes so mellow
Another nightmare
I don't want the hate and anger they gave me
All the pills and Percocets daily
Numbing and running to nothing
Just another nightmare

If I ran then I didn't get far
Just a little plus one to the really big star
Mothering me
Begging you not to leave
Roll your eyes and you call me Bruce Wayne
Say with all my years of therapy I should be Mark Twain
Will I know when I'm dead
If you beckon me back to bed?

I was trying to smile
But got blood on the tiles
It was taken away with the evidence
Shouldn't talk about that
Fell asleep on your lap
As you ran out of patience

I don't wanna wait a year to feel better
Taking everything to forget ya
Living in echoes so mellow
Another nightmare
I don't want the hate and anger they gave me
All the pills and Percocets daily
Numbing and running to nothing
Just another nightmare

They don't have to look like you do if they know

I don't wanna wait a year to feel better
Taking everything to forget ya
Living in echoes so mellow
Another nightmare
I don't want the hate and anger they gave me
All the pills and Percocets daily
Numbing and running to nothing
Just another nightmare"
Love To Walk Away,The Vaccines,"All night, all night waiting for you
Inside, outside gated and
Behind the bars I'm waiting for you
All night baby
All night

You said we should go get coffee
Tell me you don't need nobody
Heard it before - photocopy
You're so sad, so what, we're all sad

Sweet thing
I hope that you find that feeling
How come you're always leaving
You love to walk away
How are you sleeping?
It don't looking like you've been eating
We both know where this is leading
You love to walk away
You love to walk away

All night, all night waiting for you
Three flights, dehydrated and
Send cars - they all keep waiting for you

The Dreamer,The Vaccines,"I was never gonna leave you twisted
I was never gonna leave you there, yeah
With your mother and a child that I didn't wanna know
We were bleeding out our beautiful noses
We were bleeding on our beautiful clothes
We were weaving in and out of Edgar Allan Poe, oh-oh-oh

Somewhere, someone must have been watching
Hey there, I wish somebody was watching us

I know the night has got two faces
There's one that runs and one that chases
But if it caught you in between
Then I would wait for you in dreams
Right at the edges of your answers
Somewhere underneath your laughter
And if you wanna know what it all means
Then I am here for you in dreams

I was always gonna be your ending
I was always gonna meet you there, yeah
At the centre of attention right before close
I was managing your expectations
On a pick-up full of pink carnations
You were begging me to cure the sickness of a rose, oh-oh-oh

Somewhere, someone must have been watching
Hey there, do you wish somebody was watching us?

I know the night has got two faces
There's one that runs and one that chases
But if it caught you in between
Then I would wait for you in dreams
Right at the edges of your answers
Somewhere underneath your laughter
And if you wanna know what it all means
Then I am here for you in dreams

I know the night has got two faces
There's one that runs and one that chases
But if it caught you in between
Then I would wait for you in dreams
Right at the edges of your answers
Somewhere underneath your laughter
And if you wanna know what it all means
Then I am here for you in dreams"
Anonymous in Los Feliz,The Vaccines,"Last night you got in my eye line
Feels like it was a lifetime
I got in your head
Ran my fingers through all your anger
Wrapped around like an anchor
Held us by a thread

And I know it's not your fault, gave it everything you had
Can you see it's not my fault from where you're at?

Baby, don't forget when you're famous
Love's anonymous, faceless
So show yourself to me
And come on back for me
Waiting at the end of the century
I can't sleep with a memory
So show yourself to me
And come on back for me

First kiss drawing blood like it's lipstick
Using it like a mystic
Tell me who you've been
My arms start to look like a crossroads
We're the only ones lost though
Buried in between

But I know it's not your fault, there was only one way out
Can you see it's not my fault from where you're at?

Baby, don't forget when you're famous
Love's anonymous, faceless
So show yourself to me
And come on back for me
Waiting at the end of the century
I can't sleep with a memory
So show yourself to me
And come on back for me

Come on back for me
Come on back for me

Baby, don't forget when you're famous
Love's anonymous, faceless
So show yourself to me
And come on back for me
Waiting at the end of the century
I can't sleep with a memory
So show yourself to me
And come on back for me"
It Won't Always Be Like This,Inhaler,"Girl, you know this ain't love
I'm just a bedlam beggar with nothing to do
It's on you
And oh what else can I do?

You say that you're not around
And you don't wanna be found
Well, I wanna be the best at what I do
Oh what about you?
Oh what about you?

Walking 'round and 'round in circles after you
Broken and bruised

Pull the covers right up over your head

My Honest Face,Inhaler,"I could be Elvis on a Tuesday night
One, two, three, four, five, alright
I can look good in a certain light
So don't look too close at me tonight

And honey I could play the joker
My made up smile broke your heart last night
No, no, no, I didn't want to hurt you
But there's just a certain culture when you're young, when you're young

Baby, I'll take you to an honest place
Darling, I just can't find my honest face
My honest face

I could be a killer, gonna get you whacked
One, two, three, four, five in the back
And you have to get up to try and get out of hand
It's all working out just like I planned

And honey I can play the hater
Acting like I hated her last night
No, no, no, I didn't want to hurt you
But there's just a certain culture when you're young, call it fun

Baby, I'll take you to an honest place
Darling, I just can't find my honest face
My honest face

Slide Out The Window,Inhaler,"Oh, I live with the world
Like you would with an ex
I'm checking in
Where she's checking out next

She makes moves
Deep in my head
Burning a hole
Right down in my chest

Like a morning
Just slide out the window
Till the dawning
Just slide out the window

She waits for the end
Wearing a sundress
We were growing up
Now we're growing apart

Like the mornings
Just slide out the window
Till the dawning
Just slide out the window

You gotta slide
Oh, you gotta slide
Oh, you gotta slide
You gotta slide

When seasons change
And it gets dark
We'll own sunrise
Hold your breath
And cross your heart
I'll take you there

Like the morning
Just slide out the window
Till the dawning
Just slide out the window

You gotta slide
Gotta slide
You gotta slide
Slide
You gotta slide
Gotta slide
Slide
Slide"
Cheer Up Baby,Inhaler,"When I think of all the things I didn't do
Oh, I can't help but blame it on you
Oh, how to cure these February blues?
You know it's not too late
She said either way

Oh oh

All you do
Cheer up, baby
You're not on your own
Oh, she said
All you do
Cheer up, baby

Sinking like a stone

And I lie in my bed
Under the covers

Oh, and you walked into my room
To offer me a better view
Like I had no clue

Oh

All you do
Cheer up, baby
You're not on your own
Oh, she said
All you do
Cheer up, baby
You're not on your own
Sinking like a stone

Did you meet someone else?
Are they more than a friend

Are we close to the end?

All you do

A Night On The Floor,Inhaler,"Oh, this for you all lovers and your kids
You might not like it and might call me a bitch
This for all you sinners, saved by saints
God bless the madness of the fifty states

This, all you dreamers who dream in bed
Where are you going when you lay your head?
All you mothers can't believe your eyes
Pull up the covers and make it

A night on the floor
With you all night
Spend a night on the floor
On the other side

Oh, this for all you people who want what's mine
I'm on my knees, just tell me where I sign
And all you teachers under your desks
I can't believe they haven't cleaned up that mess
Oh no

Oh
Oh
Oh
Oh, oh

Let's spend a night on the floor
With you all night
Let's spend a night on the floor
With the other side

I'm not here on my own, my own, my own
My own, my own"

You lost your mind?
'Cause I've lost mine

And she says I've got no love
I fucking hate that bitch
'Cause she takes and she takes
She won't give in
And they love and they love
But I still don't fit in

When It Breaks,Inhaler,"What's it gonna take
For this storm to break
You don't know what you've got
Until it's taken away
I'm not too scared to turn and face it
While I'm just waking up
It's ch-ch-changing

I like this feeling
I'm not dreaming anymore
Upstairs is leaking
We're gonna have to kick in the door

And when it breaks
I know you're gonna be there
I know you're gonna be there
A storm's hanging over this place
You're gonna wanna see it when it breaks
I know we're gonna be there
I know we're gonna be there
I wanna see your beautiful face
You know I'm gonna be there when it breaks

(When it breaks)

How much does it ache
When your bones break?
It seems so hard to tell
What's real or fake
Can't let this moment go to waste

I love this feeling
We're not dreaming anymore

I know you're gonna be there
I know you're gonna be there
A storm's hanging over this place
You're gonna wanna see it when it breaks
I know we're gonna be there
We're all gonna be there
We'll see your beautiful face
You know I'm gonna be there when it breaks

Like Paris in '45
The whole world's waiting to come alive
I know you're gonna be there
I know you're gonna be there when it breaks

I know you're gonna be there
I know we're gonna be there
Such a beautiful place
I know I'm gonna be there when it breaks
I know we're gonna be there
Imagine what we'll see there
Statues down in every town

You're gonna see it when it breaks
You're gonna see it when it breaks
You're gonna see it"
Who's Your Money On? (Plastic House),Inhaler,"I was just getting to know you
When I turned my back
Did I miss my chance?
You almost slipped through my hands

Oh, we could go around to a friend's house and get stoned
We can talk about things we never say when we're alone

Who's your money on?
Who you gonna put your money on?
Who's gonna keep you alive?
I'll put myself on the line

I know that you can feel it
I built my walls too high
Not tryna scare you off
I've just been hiding in my head for so long

Oh, we could go around to a friend's house and get stoned
I wanna tell you some things I could never really tell you before

Who's your money on?
Who you gonna put your money on?
Who's gonna keep you alive?
I'll put myself on the line

I owe you more than I had
You can tell me the cost
I should have taken your hand
Somewhere I got lost

Without you, the odds are not in my favour
We've got everything to lose and everything to play for

You know how it goes
This plastic house ain't built to last
Things are just like they always are
We melt like ice in your hands

It won't last
Time will pass
The thunder comes
On so fast

Who's your money on?
This plastic house is built on sand"
Totally,Inhaler,"Oh I am totally blind
You are totally deaf
When I ask for a smoke
You've only got one left
We talk until the sun comes up
But still can't relate
You play the same song
Over again
Don't turn it up
I don't want to hear it
I said

Why does it hurt me so much?
Oh tell me why does it hurt me so much?

I could be totally mad
You could be going insane
I think you live in a dream
You say I'm empty and vain
And when the sun comes up
I know what you're gonna say
That after all this time
I'm not yours, you're not mine
I'm still sitting here
And I don't wanna leave

Oh tell me why does it hurt me so much?
Oh tell me why does it hurt me so much?

If I could I would take full control of it all
You know you don't even mean that much, so

Why
Can't I just let go?
Oh tell me why
Maybe I'll never know

So tell me why does it hurt me so much?
Oh tell me why does it hurt me so much?"

Just To Keep You Satisfied,Inhaler,"It was early in the morning
The first day of the week
I couldn't face the faces in my personality
Maybe I'll be stronger
Maybe I'm a freak
Maybe I'll be faithful even if I was a cheat

Breaking through the seams
Sticking to the ceiling by the bottoms of our feet

So Far So Good,Inhaler,"Well I'm feeling good

These Are The Days,Inhaler,"I'm stranded here again, another Friday night
Turn up the music, black out the lights
Best kinda scene, I shouldn't have been
Bandits in charge of the silver machine
One of our friends is along for the ride
Hangin' from the window, out of his mind
I don't want my luck to fall at my feet
Don't wanna feel a thing, just wanna hear you scream, yeah

These are
These are the days that follow you home
These are the days that kiss you on your broken nose
These are the days, I don't miss the feeling of being alone
These are the days, these are the days

We were breakin' the limit, then we broke down
Turned to the left to some no-name town
Everybody's got a dream, I like it best when I'm in it
Comin' round the corner, I'll be there in a minute
And I'm comin' up on somethin' sweet
I'm leavin' with the first person I meet
I'm holdin' out, I'm hangin' on
For that moment where it all goes wrong, yeah

These are
These are the days that follow you home
These are the days that kiss you on your broken nose
These are the days, I don't miss the feeling of being alone
These are the days, these are the days

They said we can do anything we want
For a while
They say
And tell you to behave
With a smile
Don't turn
Don't turn and run away
Don't hide
'Cause we can do anything we want
For a while

I think we're gonna be okay
Yeah, I think we're gonna be okay

If You’re Gonna Break My Heart,Inhaler,"We woke up faded
From the shape of the night
Couldn't find the words
Couldn't find the light
We got caught in the tide
And the shore was on the other side
There's no other way around
Up or down
When the sun shines
On my insides

If you're gonna break my heart
Smash it to pieces
'Cause I'm not gonna need it
As much as I do right now
Right now

I showed you mercy
You gave me murder
I got your ten tonne monkey
Jumping up on my back
We got caught in the ride
Of being young and alive
There's no other way around
Up or down
But some nights
Yeah, that's alright

If you're gonna break my heart
Smash it to pieces
'Cause I'm not gonna need it
As much as I do right now
If you're gonna break my heart
Smash it to pieces
'Cause I'm not gonna need it
As much as I do right now

Say what you're gonna say anyway
Nothing really means as much as you do
I should be on my way but I can't help
Waiting for you

To come and break my heart
And smash it to pieces
'Cause I'm not gonna need it
As much as I do right now
If you're gonna break my heart
Smash it to pieces

Oh, oh, oh, oh

As advertised
A vacancy to play the part
Was something wrong right from the start?
Do not touch if you've not bought
There's something in the house
I hear noises in the walls
Yeah phone the exorcist
Wake me when he calls

There's something
So why are we trying to kill
Something that's been so good?
I can't explain it now
So wait

There's something in the room
With us tonight
It's caught between the dawn
And morning light
Something that you said
That drove it home
Left me underneath
In your perfect storm

Something that you said
That changed the tide
Tangled in the weight
Of our own lies
Is everything we had
As good as gone?
Lying in the wreck
Of your perfect storm

Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh"
Dublin in Ecstasy,Inhaler,"What are you thinking, my love
Over there in the arms of somebody
Is all your dreaming about
Standing next to me
We were young and amused
Now we're dancing to a tune
We can't be who we used to be
Dublin in ecstasy

We got high from time to time
I recalled the shiver
Running down my spine
I can see the city in the glass of your eye
And when you take your shot
I'll be there this time
This time

Where the arc lights
Used to dampen and die
We were never thinking much
Only sometimes

We got high from time to time
I recalled the shiver
Running down my spine
I can see the city in the glass of your eye
And when you take your shot
I'll be there this time
Dublin in ecstasy

I only want to speak if you have the time
I only wanna fight if it's for your life
I only wanna speak if you have the time
Not just a friend of a friend of mine

Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh"
When I Have Her On My Mind,Inhaler,"I'm walking by
Where I first met you
I'm saying hello
But I don't wanna forget
We let the summer burn
Through the month of November
We used to fly so high
From what I remember

You can try
But I won't care
We can drive for miles
But only she can get me there
And all your signs
I'm glad they don't lead me anywhere
I don't wanna burn out, baby
So why can't I stay a while
When I have her on my mind
On my mind

Time goes by
Still it won't move me
And the words I should have found
Came to me too slowly
You're trying your best
To please somebody
No one said it would be hard
But goodbyes are never easy

You can try
But I won't care
We can drive for miles
But only she can get me there
And all your signs
I'm glad they don't lead me anywhere
I don't wanna burn out, baby
So why can't I stay a while
When I have her on my mind
On my mind

You say you never saw it coming
But you ain't got that thing she has
I know enough about it
Take me as I am
Or leave here fast
I don't wanna hear about it
Got the wrong place
At the right time
You know why, but you can't win
Yeah, you know
She's on my mind
All the time

Yeah, you know
When I have her on my mind
Yeah, you know
When I have her on my mind
When I have her on my mind"
Valentine,Inhaler,"I got a bone to pick with you
But don't worry, I'm not mad
There's something great about us, but
I should've took a step back
From that fuzzy feeling
Stuck on the end of your line
They say you got a dangerous hook
Assures me I'll be fine

Be my valentine
Come on, spell it out
Be my
Yeah, be my valentine
You could never shoot me down

We got nothing to do
Settle into my cage
Until the wind blows me through
Ride into your wave

I need you on good days
And on the bad ones too
They say you're hard to please, but
I'll still give myself to you

Be my valentine
Come on, spell it out
Well, be my
Be my valentine
You can try to shoot me down
You could never shoot me down

Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh

Be my
Oh, be my valentine
Come on, spell it out
Oh, be my
Oh, be my valentine
Don't let me down
You could never shoot me down

Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh

Oh, be my
Yeah, be my valentine
And let them try to shoot us down
You could never shoot me down"
The Things I Do,Inhaler,"You can't say I lost myself
If you don't know me at all
Yes, there's still a bitter taste
Hiding under my tongue
And I'm just waiting for the night we both get down
On our knees
How much does forgiveness really count
On days like these?

You say a lot of things
And act so wise
In spite of all the joy
You still terrorise
You still need me
But it's just because of you

I still don't know why I do the things
Why I do the things I do
I still don't know why
I do the things

You say it's meaningless
To look the other way
I'm begging for a hand
To get me out of this place
Because I'll take this Armageddon
To the grave
So can we fix this love of ours?
It's getting late
I can't see straight

You say a lot of things
And act so wise
In spite of all the joy
You still terrorise
You still need me
But it's just because of you

I still don't know why I do the things
Why I do the things I do
I still don't know why I do the things

You say a lot of things
And act so wise
In spite of all the joy
You still terrorise
You still need me
You still need me
You still need me
But it's just because of you

I still don't know why I do the things
I do the things I do
I still don't know

It's just because of you
I still don't know why I do the things
Why I do the things I do
I still don't why I do the things
Why I do the things I do
I do, I do
Do the things I do
I still don't know why I do these things"
Now You Got Me,Inhaler,"You felt like a kid when you heard that sound
For the first time
Like a song at the back of your head
It was your little secret
Now you got me wherever you want me
Do I want you to say it back?
Because we can't stay
Let's run away, oh

Now you got me where you want me
'Cause you know
Now you got me where you want me
It's just about seven o'clock
Now you got me where you want me
Ah-ah-ah
I just want to let you know

Take me down to the place by the beach
Where we dreamed our days away
Say the word and I'll be there
Love won't tear us apart
I don't know what I would do
Nothing could drag me away, away from you
Where you can drown your fear
And I'll be there for the taking

Now you got me where you want me
'Cause you know
Now you got me where you want me, oh
It's just about seven o'clock
Now you got me where you want me
Ah-ah-ah
I just want to let you know

I'll go with you
Yeah, anywhere
When lightning strikes
I'm hypnotised
Yeah, say it 'cause

Now you got me where you want me
'Cause you know
Now you got me where you want me, oh
It's just about seven o'clock
Now you got me where you want me
Ah-ah-ah
I just want to let you know
Which is nowhere
I'd be nowhere
I'd be nowhere
Nowhere"
Open Wide,Inhaler,"Messed up in bed
Dreams held us higher
We swore that nothing could come and free us
When it's too hard to stretch out over wire
The need for silence slowly killing you

I don't need these ties
As much as I need freedom from you
You got your arms out open wide
You say come on baby, take a look

I'll stay with you
When you are cruel to the violent thoughts in your head
But sometimes you'll do much worse
You can't reverse the beautiful things you said

Yeah, in blue jeans, the faded color
'Cause we wear them always
Yeah, we trampled on holy ground
So you could throw your toys out of the crib

And I'll hold down these ties
As much as I want freedom from you
You got your arms out open wide
You say ""come on baby, take a look""

I'll stay with you
When you are cruel to the violent thoughts in your head
Sometimes you'll do much worse
You can't reverse the beautiful things you said

Yeah
Love is a terror, when they stick together
Love is a terror if it's all forever
Love is a terror
Got my arms out open wide
Got my arms out open wide
Yeah, arms out open wide
Come on baby take a look
Inside

I'll stay with you
When you are cruel to the violent thoughts in your head
But sometimes you'll do much worse
You can't reverse the beautiful things you said

Got my arms out open wide
You got your arms out open wide
Your arms out open wide
Your arms out open wide"
Your House,Inhaler,"Right around six or something
There I was
Barefoot in the street
Where I thought I'd
Float through your door
And I'd... I'd been there before
But I ain't so

Oh love
I'm going nowhere you won't find me
Maybe I sold love
For what it's worth on the street
Said oh love
There ain't a sharp enough knife
To cut me out of your life
I'm going to your house tonight

And there's gold in the sky
In the city we tried
Shining East of your face
Thought you'd aim at her gates
Though there's nothing to say
But I'm...

Oh love
I'm going nowhere you won't find me
Maybe I sold love
For what it's worth on the street
Said oh love
There ain't a sharp enough knife
To cut me out of your life
Who's going to your house tonight?

I'm leaving everything to you
So save me the trouble
As you're sliding into view
Save me the trouble

Oh love
I'm going nowhere you won't find me
Maybe I sold love
For what it's worth on the street
Said oh love
There ain't a sharp enough knife
To cut me out of your life
Who's going to your house tonight?

Who's going to your house tonight?
Tonight, tonight, tonight
Who's going to your house tonight?
Tonight, tonight, tonight"
Chloe Kelly,Surf Curse,"I tried so hard to stay the same
But it's so hard
When you're trying to change
I'm getting tired of your face
Cause all this shit
Is rotting my brain

You don't listen to anything I say
Anyways

I feel so sick when I think of you

Heathers,Surf Curse,"You should call me tonight
While you are sleeping
So I can talk to
All of you dreams

And they'll tell me what to do
When I'm alone with you
Cause I really do not understand
What the fuck is wrong with you

I've been crazy for this boy

Because Heather I hate you"

The Smell Saved My Life,Surf Curse,"Woo-oooooooo (oooo)

Goth Babe,Surf Curse,"I want a goth babe in my life
I want someone I can bite
I want to listen to the cure
I want to tell you that I'm yours

We can shoegaze in my room
So we can sing about our gloom
I want to feel you in my soul

If you feel the way I do
If you feel the way I do

I want a goth babe in my head
A girl dressed in black in red
To do a seance in my bed
And then we'll fuck till we're both dead

Candle wax dropped on my nips
While we worship Robert Smith
I want to feel you in my soul

If you feel the way I do
If you feel the way I do"

Dreamin' Wild"
Fire Walk With Me,Surf Curse,"Fire walk away with me, tonight, tonight
I wrote in my diary that I'm fine, that I'm fine
Let's hang out by the train tracks, tonight, tonight
Split that golden heart with me, I'll be your guy, your guy

Fire walk with me, fire walk with me
Fire walk with me, fire walk with me

Let's get drunk in my room, it's red, it's red
There is something in my room, in my head, in my head

Fire walk with me, fire walk with me"

The Strange and the Kind,Surf Curse,"Oh I wish we
Had a little more time
Because days are just days
For the rest of our lives

And if you leave
They will leave you behind
And if you stay
They will stay on your mind

Cause I thought that I'd know everything
By this time
But I'll be dazed and confused
All my life

Oh I wish we could stay out all night
Let the wind cool our hair
As we drive

Through the years
Of the strange and the kind
Through the change that never came
When we liked

Cause I thought that I'd know everything
But this time
But I'll be dazed and confused
Oh I'll be dazed and confused
All my life"

And I almost got away

But it followed me
But it followed me

And I've been here for days
And I hope that I won't change
Until it swallows me

I don't want you to walk

It's been harder than I thought
And the feelings oh so strange

And I've been here for days
And the feeling never fades
It just follows me
It just follows me"
Cronenberg,Surf Curse,"I wish I could see you
I wish we could talk
I wish I could be you
I wish we could love
Cutting me open
Cutting me off
Off of your body
Out of your blood

I wish you could hide
Under my skin
My eyes
Into your womb
Out of your mind

Falling Apart,Surf Curse,"There's blood in my heart
But none in the rest of me

I'm losing myself
Due to a lack of sleep
I'll never quite be
What people expect of me

I'm falling apart
I've fallen too far
I'm falling apart
I've fallen too far

There's blood in my throat
Enough to choke on it

By something I can't resist

Outside I will wait for you to know
I'll try while I wait for you to know
Outside I will wait for you to know

I am dead and I never said that you were wrong

Outside I will wait for you to know
I'll try while I wait for you to know"
River's Edge,Surf Curse,"I don't recognize myself
Maybe it's for the better
I've always felt like someone else
And maybe I'd feel better
Living on the rivers edge
Where nothing is ever said
And all the people never forget
All the things you never said

I hope I can still write songs
When my memories are all gone
I hope I can hear you sing when I'm sick of everything
Living on the rivers edge
Where nothing is ever said
And all the people never forget
All the things you never said"
Midnight Cowboy,Surf Curse,"Hope I don't wake you tonight
But the boy knows when the money's tight
Walking around under neon lights
Find me a lover if the money's right

I've been living like a midnight cowboy
Showing it off to the cruisers eyes
I've been living like a midnight cowboy
Dreaming of days of a different life

Some of them I meet at the bars
And some of them want me in their cars
When they take me I close my eyes
Imagine you living the desert life

I've been living like a midnight cowboy
Showing it off to the cruisers eyes
I've been living like a midnight cowboy
Dreaming of days of a different life

I've been, oh I've been
I've been living like a midnight cowboy
I've been, oh I've been
I've been living like a midnight cowboy
I've been, oh I've been

Hour of the Wolf,Surf Curse,"Beware of the bleeding moon
Cause I'm still missing you all day
In every way
Beware of the witching hour
Cause I can feel you in my room
Is that still you

Beware of the buried child
He runs oh so wild and free
He's just like me
But I can't touch your skin
It burns with the shitty grin of Zeus
And heaven surrounds you

Beware of the bleeding moon
Cause I'm still missing you all day
In every way"
Dead Ringers,Surf Curse,"If you find that instrument

Safe,Surf Curse,"There goes my name
There goes my way
I'm feeling so cold
I'm feeling so safe
I held you today
I held you away
I feel so alone
I'm safer alone
Here we go

There goes my face
All of the ways
It twisted and maimed
When I tore it away
I'm ugly today
In so many ways
I can't leave my home
I'm safer at home
Here we go
I'm safe alone
I'm safe alone
I'm safe alone
I'm safe alone
I'm safe alone"
Memory,Surf Curse,"Loose lips
Told me all your secrets
Runnin your fingers thru my hair
And you whispered
All your serious thoughts
To see if
I'd follow them along

It's just a distant memory
That's always gonna follow me

Remember
When we went to Tahoe Lake
In the summer
The water wasn't tamed
And we sang every Pavement song we could
And your Malkmus was just so damn good"
Opera,Surf Curse,"I'll see you on the stage tonight
Breaking hearts and changing lives
You were always good at changing mine
At the opera house in the pale blue light
Cause I know it hurts to close your eyes
So I'd rather you just watch me die
And I know you must be terrified
Just stare into my dying eyes
This time

I wonder if he'll come tonight
Tie my wrists and fuck my mind
Cause it's getting late and I'm oh so tired
Of the games we play with each other's lives
Cause it hurts so much to close my eyes
But I never wanna watch you die
And I'd rather make myself go blind
Then stare into your dying eyes
So I'll close mine"
Trust,Surf Curse,"Beyond me
Questions seep
And I can't breath
So lean on my
Go go go won't you please
Slow slow slow enough for me
With your trust so clean
Baby take a chance on me

Lovers leave
When I can't breath
Just lean on me
Come come come come to me
So so so afraid of things
And she said to me
Baby take a chance on me"
Jamie,Surf Curse,"Another night of feeling lonely and confused
Then I get the call from Jamie saying hey boo boo
We need to have some we need a good time We need this in our lives
It's all from the wild one I'm never gonna deny

It was meant
To be like this
All of your friends
Really make thinks clear

We hit the bar and any place with a dance floor
We sing our songs and let our memories unfold
Watching a smile so honest, so lovely and hopeful
Thanking my lucky stars for giving me people to live for

It was meant
To be like this
All of your friends
Really make thinks clear

I love all the people in my life
All my friends keep me alive"
Arrow,Surf Curse,"I've been talking to myself
But I don't know what to say
Guess I never had the chance
To get the words right anyway
There's a shadow on my smile
Leave a light on for the pain
Speak it when I lose myself
Write it down when I give it away
I've been trying to love myself
Shoot an arrow in my brain
Hit the floor and I'm bleeding out
Guess I should work on my aim
Lost in time and angel's breath
I get dizzy from the flame
Getting high on eagle death
Bitter honor for the shame

Lost in time and angel's breath
I get dizzy from the flame
Getting high on eagle death
Bitter honor for the shame

There's a shadow on my smile
Leave a light on for the pain
Scream it when I lose myself
Bitter honor for the shame"
Cathy,Surf Curse,"Cathy
Are you feeling lonely?
I wanna walk and talk with you
Till they put me in the grave

Cathy
If you really trust me
I'll keep you company
Do my best to never get in your way

Gimmie the time and the place and I'll come running
Put a smile on my face, make me feel so god damn lucky
Nobody's perfect, you're worth it, where did you come from?
It's an honor, a pleasure to love someone like you
Oh, Cathy

Cathy
Are you feeling grumpy
It's a tough ol' world
But I can hold you through those dark days

Cathy
Are you in their drawing
Even though you're sad
You know how to make the people laugh

Gimmie the time and the place and I'll come running
Put a smile on my face, make me feel so god damn lucky

Sugar,Surf Curse,"I look like shit but I feel even worse
In the tired times
When my body finally can get hurt

I look like hell 'cause I'm going there first
My god you are such a looker
Tell me you love me and give me some sugar

I feel a sweet tooth in my mind
I hate the way it makes me feel sometimes
I'd cut it out but I'd just find
No one likes a ton of sugar
Tell me you love me and give me some sugar"
Lost Honor,Surf Curse,"I'm not afraid when I got you on my mind
They can say what they want but I don't care about your crimes
They tore my walls, my pictures, my memories
They can't touch the love in my heart and the things you've given me

I put my hand on your hip
And you gave me that look
I want days where you remember me
It's what I saw in your eyes
And what happened that night
I want days where you remember me

They make you out to be some kind of monster
But I only know you as the kindest lover
But people just want their feelings and make-believe
All for the sake of destroying you and me
And our New Year's memories

When they put me in the cuffs
And you gave me that look
I want years where you remember me
And when we push through the guards
A final kiss never dies
I won't lie, will you remember me?

It's a cruel harsh world
But I know you believe in me
It's a cruel harsh world
But I know you believe in me
It's a cruel harsh world
But I know you believe in me
It's a cruel harsh world
But I know you believe in me

I don't wanna live and die
In the public eye, live a private life
I don't wanna live and die
In the public eye, live a private life

I don't wanna live and die
In the public eye, live a private life
I don't wanna live and die
In the public eye, live a private life
I don't wanna live and die

I don't wanna live and die"
Self Portrait,Surf Curse,"Life's not always kind
You better get used to it
Painting with a knife
To get me through it

I am full of fear
And contradictions
Easier to hear
Beautiful fiction

My brain is automatic
It always shifts with no break
I wanna do without it
I wanna sleep for a day

A self portrait gave me hope for today
Just like the rest I threw it away

Yeah!"
Unwell,Surf Curse,"I'm so worried to be alone
And it's too late to drive you home

I'm so worried to be alive
Lie awake in my miserable mind
'Cause I think that I'm starting to tell
That I'm hurling, I'm twirling
I'm drifting away into the arena of the unwell

Can you tell?
Can you tell?
I'm so unwell

I'm so worried to be myself
In the age of the personal hell
But I know that I'm doing it right
When I'm screaming, I'm gnawing
I'm drifting away and I'm losing my goddamn mind

Can you tell?
Can you see?
Please, God, help me"
Strange,Surf Curse,"It's so strange
Breaking habits of darker days
And it's so cool
Hiding behind the scarlet moon
Where I don't understand it
A jester in the show
Like a cruel dark magic
I guess I'll never know

Why it's so strange
Used to laugh but now it's pain
And it's so cruel
On the other side of the scarlet moon
There's a big black magic
Ripping away your tomb
So pure it's tragic
That we'll never stay in tune

Never thought that I could be so manic
I never wanted too
Falling upwards over and over
Running through fire with you
Running through fire with you
Running through fire with you

Never thought that I could be so manic
I never wanted too
Falling upwards over and over
Running through fire with you
Running through fire with you
Running through fire with you

Take your time, free your mind, I can do this every day
Ten o'clock, TVI, give me mine, take me away
Higher noon, leaving soon, red balloon, take me away
Feel alive, TVI, give me mine, take me out

When I was a boy
I went down to the sound and I found all the current joys
Now I could die
At the thought of a kid's or a fear in another night

Take your time, free your mind, I can do this every day
Ten o'clock, TVI, give me mine, take me away

Little Rock ‘n’ Roller,Surf Curse,"Little rock 'n' roller
Could've fooled me
You got style and you got taste
Watch a big ol' smile
Grow upon your face
Do my best to keep it in its place

Who could've known we'd end up here tonight?
Most of days I'm just holding on for dear life
When I feel low I get high when I look in those eyes
It's that real love that is born in real time

Now we're kissing on the wall
In front of everyone
How the fuck did we end up here?
But I know that you can't stay
Drive back to the bay
But I'll keep you in my heart

Who could've known we'd end up here tonight?
Most of days I'm just holding on for dear life

No Tomorrows,Surf Curse,"Doesn't really matter
What happened in the past
If you could stay here in the moment
Who knows how long it'll last
You and I are runners
Just trying to find an end
Chasing down a piece of mind
But we hold on to our regrets

I don't think I can
For you I will try
All of my fears
Lose to your good times

Kiss before the apocalypse
Is love remembered in the end
The mind keeps on hanging
'Cause we're reminded of the dread
But can I stick with you
You've always been a good friend
Isn't that the point of living
Or am I fool for saying that

I don't think I can
For you I will try
All of my fears
Lose to your good times

I'll keep trying to fight and stay
But I don't know about tomorrow
Breaks my heart to feel this way
There's no more dreams that I could follow

I'll keep trying to fight and stay
But I don't know about tomorrow
Breaks my heart to feel this way
There's no more dreams that I could follow

I'll keep trying to fight and stay

Fear City,Surf Curse,"One last breath in fear city
Hold me close 'cause I can't hold on anymore
Oh, what a shame such a pity
I can't indulge myself in the feeling anymore
When I look in the rear view mirror I see burning buildings
Oh, it fills me with, oh, such feelings
Oh, mercy killings
I might just cum at the sound of the dying child in me
""Wait, what did he say?""
I said my hairs just way too short to make a living
""That's definitely not what he said""
But my hairs never been a good measure of my happiness, so I...

I've lived here now for awhile
But most of the times, I just get lost in the days
Hey you, over there with the beautiful smile (""Who, me?"")
Yeah, the gapped tooth and the years of denial
Do you have something else that you'd like to say?
""Well, actually, yes, when I was a kid I was obsessed with science
And saw so many random acts of va-va-va-va-violence
The method of the madness made me think I like it
The science of silence, the silence of violence""
So what came first, the silence or violence?
""Oh hunny, you know it really depends on what you're buying these days""

All of my friends call me a light sleeper
Well, I guess that I just don't dream anymore
I used to call the shots but sometimes the shots just have to call themselves
Like making a U-turn on the belt of the highway, I can do it my way now

Like turning around to the burning building
I threw it away for the better living
One at a time and I stepped right in
The carnal knowledge embraced my skin
The smoke from the halls sank in my nose, my eyes, my soul, my shit, my grin
I screamed for my life, I screamed, I screamed, ""Help me""
No one can hear you in the walls of sin
Concrete floors that I love living in
One last breath before I give in
Just one last breath before it's Christmas morning
The bells are out and I'm in mourning
Wish I had a sign, wish I had a warning
That the bells of Heaven would come and erase my nose, my eyes, my sin, my face
On New Years Eve
The years behind are just another reason to lead
All the beautiful lives we lead
When fear is all we need
What a beautiful life

What a beautiful life
What a beautiful life"
Randall Flagg,Surf Curse,"Times are hard enough without the changes
Wild fires started by a cool wind

And I can taste it
Like a ruby
In the pavement
In the backyard
Of my sick head
I need holding
I need saving

Cause I'm a fuck up
But I'm famous
What a combo
For entertainment
I want to trust you
But the thief said
Don't bet on me
Don't bet on me

Saw myself inside a painting
Startled by the way my face bent
And I hate Tennessee, and I hate Vegas
Place your bets, baby
Don't bet on me
Don't bet on me

Cause I'm tired
And I'm anxious
Of the monster
In my basement
It eats jewelry
It eats children
It comes through me

He thinks he's hard, a powdered mouth that tastes of gin
He's just been barred for that blues he was smoking

God, I love the way you love yourself
Your obsession with rocks and brown
And fucking the whole town's
A reflection on your mental health

Much younger than you are now
And once we started having friends round
You created a television of your mouth

It's just you and I tonight

Sha Sha Sha,Fontaines D.C.,"You're so real, I'm a show reel
You work for money and the rest, you steal
I feel like an old tattoo
I feel like I'm falling for you

Sha sha sha, sha sha sha
Sha sha sha

A cabbie pisses in the wheel of his own car
Heads hit the streets, turn cheeks at stars
There's always tears
There's always gonna be tears
There's always gonna be

Sha sha sha, sha sha sha
Sha sha sha, sha sha sha

Under the lamplight's faded career
Two men at a rickshaw pumping up a tyre
Tire and tire and tire and tire
Tire and tire and tire and tire
And now the cabbie waits at invisible gates
Shoulder to the curb
Manic and wretching like a drunken perv
Now here comes the sun
That's another one done
That's another one

Too Real,Fontaines D.C.,"Ah

None can pull the passion loose from youth's ungrateful hands
As it stands, I'm about to make a lot of money
Gold harps in the pan
None can revolution lead with selfish needs aside
As I cried, I'm about to make a lot of money
Gold harps on the side

Is it too real for ya?
Is it too real for ya?
Is it too real for ya?
Is it too real?

The winter evening settles down
The bruised and beat up open sky, six o'clock
The city in its final dress
And now a gusty shower wraps the grimy scraps
Of withered leaves all about your feet
And then the wringing of a twitching hand
Six o'clock, six o'clock

Is it too real for ya?
Is it too real for ya?
Is it too real for ya?
Is it too real?
Is it too real for ya?

Television Screens,Fontaines D.C.,"Saw the ice face fail
For the first time in years
And the water levels rise
'Round the television screens
All your tough man looks
For which you had reserved
For a room full of mirrors

On the television screen
On the television screen
On the television screen
On the television screen

They fell as a child
On the beatdown grass
No cutting, no bruising
Not a mark to be seen
And so some become lost
As their passions will see
Illustrated well
By the television screen
Shall we tangle our thinking?
Shall we give it a name?
Let it sit at the table
Bring it in from the rain
I could lay you right down
On these lively living streets
And still you'd not know
How the city heart beats

On the television screen
On the television screen
On the television screen
On the television screen

You're a cluster of nothing
You are a beauty for the sake
How dare you go about living
As a relic from a dream
As the sky shutters down
On the antiquated scene
On the room full of mirrors

On the television screen
On the television screen
On the television screen

Hurricane Laughter,Fontaines D.C.,"I was toweled up to the waist while you were fresh from the confession
The angry streets, they twisted up and billowed with the laughter
Anyway I thought you burned the rags in some kind of primal fear
And now the night is blue and red and they're tearing down the plaster

Hurricane laughter
Hurricane laughter
Tearing down the plaster
Hurricane laughter
Hurricane laughter
Tearing down the plaster

And there is no connection available
And there is no connection available
And there is no connection available
There is no connection available

So to the hills we fled while the evidence was weighing
Eyes aloft all shocking, blue and purple, serious
Cities barking by the windows screaming to exist
Not without the muted mind of priesthood so imperious

Hurricane laughter

Tearing down the plaster

Dublin City Sky,Fontaines D.C.,"I was down the bottom half of some old bar in Chinatown
Me shoes had brought the rain and soaked the space for lookin' down
As drunk as love is lethal, I spun a lady 'round
And I kissed her 'neath the waking of a Dublin City sky

She threw her shoes into her bag and danced just like a dream
Her face was rubied up just like no sun I'd ever seen
She said I was a phony, I said I could be mean
And I treated her so badly I made my baby cry

The January markets filled the cold air with the sound
The boys all full of laughter and their pocket with the pound
And in the foggy dew, I saw you throwing shapes around
It was underneath the waking of a Dublin City sky

And it all makes sour
To watch my lover wrap her arms around the flag of power
Hurry now you will
To know you is to love you and I love you even still
But we'll never truly be
We trip along disaster in the whirlwind of the free
Altogether now

I Don't Belong,Fontaines D.C.,"You shoulda heard me in the lounger
Telling people what they was
Spitting out all types of sugar
Just dying for a cause, cause, cause

On a face so true
My word is always in the ready
And I'll attribute that to you

I don't belong to anyone
I don't belong to anyone
I don't belong to anyone
I don't wanna belong to anyone

You shoulda heard him in the bowery
Learning people with a tongue
Cut from second-hand cloth
Make the women feel young

I heard him serving as a soldier
In the annex of the earth
Threw himself before a bullet
And threw the metal to the dirt
Hear the man's word

Oh Such A Spring,Fontaines D.C.,"Down by the docks
The weather was fine
The sailors were drinking American wine
And I wished I could go back to spring again

Now they're all gone
That's life moving on
Some stayed behind to get drunk on the song
And they wish they could go back to spring again
Oh, such a spring
Oh, such a spring
Oh, such a spring

The noise of the town
The salt in the air
It plays all around but I no longer care
And I wish I could go back to spring again

And down through the years

And look forward to a brighter future

Bring your own two cents
Never borrow them from someone else
Buy yourself a flower every hundredth hour
Throw your hair down from your lonely tower
And if, and if
You find yourself in the family way
Give the kid more than what you got in your day

Life ain't always empty
Life ain't always empty
Life ain't always empty
Life ain't always empty
Life ain't always empty
Life ain't always empty

Never let a clock tell you what you got time for
It only goes around, goes around, goes around
Take your family name for your own great sins
Cuz each day is where it all begins

And
Don't give up too quick
You only get one line - you better make it stick
If we give ourselves to every breath
Then we're all in the running for a hero's death

Life ain't always empty
Life ain't always empty
Life ain't always empty
Life ain't always empty
Life ain't always empty

And when the sun comes up, you'll find a brand new God

Gonna get just what I want
And I am gonna get it quick

Like it's something to do
I'm a voluntary victim
Watch your colonial tongue
I'll watch you tighten the noose
I'm burning in your mad IQ
I'm burning in your mad IQ

The apocalypse is coming
Don't you lose all your control
'Cause you can't get into Heaven
If you haven't got a soul
You can never ever stop me
If you are sick or you're obscene
You can bend or you can break
But they'll replace you with machines

Nobody Likes The Opening Band,I DONT KNOW HOW BUT THEY FOUND ME,"Oh, come and see the opening band
Now that you've got your tickets and beverages in hand
They look so tired
Sound uninspired
Guitars are secondhand

And I've never heard of them
And chances are
They wont go far
Career is sure to end
'Cause no one likes an opening band

Oh, unfamiliar things will make us nervous
But singing here for you
Gives me a purpose, so...

Take pity on the opening bands
'Cause no one came to see them
Except their mom and dad
But if you lend an ear and give them
Just one little chance...

You may just like the...
You may just like the...
You may just like the opening...

With sparkled tongues and politics
In a facist little paradox
We all become anonymous

You're not from New York City, you're from Rotherham
So get off the bandwagon, and put down the handbook
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Get off the bandwagon and put down the handbook
Get off the bandwagon and put down the handbook
Get off the bandwagon and put down the handbook
Get off the bandwagon and put down the handbook, yeah"
Dancing Shoes,Arctic Monkeys,"Get on your dancing shoes
There's one thing on your mind
Hoping they're looking for you
Sure you'll be rummaging through

And the shit, shock, horror
You've seen your future bride
Yeah, but it's oh so absurd
For you to say the first word
So you're waiting and waiting and

The only reason that you came
So what you scared for?
Why don't you always do the same?
It's what you're there for, don't you know?

...the lights are flashing
Down in here tonight
And some might exchange a glance
But keep pretending to dance

But don't act like it's not happening
As if it's impolite
To go and mention your name
Instead you'll just do the same
As they all do, and hope for the best...

The only reason that you came
So what you scared for?
Why don't you always do the same?
It's what you're there for but no

Get on your dancing shoes
You sexy little swine
Hoping they're looking for you
Sure you'll be rummaging through

And I said the shit, shock, horror
You've seen your future bride
Yeah, but it's oh so absurd
For you to say the first word
So you're waiting and waiting"
You Probably Couldn't See For The Lights But You Were Staring Straight At Me,Arctic Monkeys,"One look sends it coursing through the veins oh how the feeling races
Back up to their brains to form expressions on their stupid faces

They don't want to say hello
Like I want to say hello
Well, my heart beats at its peak,
When you're coming up to speak

And oh I'm so tense, never tenser
Could all go a bit Frank Spencer?
And I'm talking gibberish,
Tip of the tongue but I can't deliver it

...Properly, oh it's all getting on top of me
And if it weren't this dark you'd see how red my face has gone, yeah

Everybody's trying to crack the jokes and that to make you smile
Those that claim that they're not showing off are drowning in denial
But they're not half as bad as me say anything and I'll agree
'Cause when it comes to acting up, I'm sure I could write the book

And now that you're more than a part in the play
It's slightly easier to think what to say
You had us all standing on our heads
Doing our best tricks, yeah

Never again, never again, oh, will there be another one quite as desirable as you

One look sends it coursing through the veins oh how the feeling races
Back up to their brains to form expressions on their stupid faces"
Still Take You Home,Arctic Monkeys,"Well, it's ever so funny
'Cause I don't think you're special, I don't think you're cool
You're just probably alright
But under these lights you look beautiful
And I'm struggling
I can't see through your fake tan
Yeah, and you know it for a fact
That everybody's eating out of your hands

But what do you know?
Oh, you know nothing
Yeah, but I'll still take you home
Oh, yeah, I'll still take you home
So what do you know?
Said you don't know nothing

Well, fancy seeing you in here
You're all tarted up and you don't look the same
Well, I haven't seen you since last year
Yeah, surprisingly you have forgotten my name
But you know it
Yeah, and you knew it all along
Oh, and you say you have forgotten
But you're fibbing, go on, tell me I'm wrong

So what do you know?
Oh, you know nothing
Yeah, but I'll still take you home
Oh, yeah, I'll still take you home
So what do you know?
Oh, you don't know nothing, no

So what do you know?
Yeah, you don't know nothing
Yeah, but I'll still take you home
Oh, yeah, I'll still take you home
I said what do you know?
Oh, you don't know nothing, no

I fancy you with a passion
You're a Topshop princess, a rockstar too
But you're a fad, you're a fashion
And I'm having a job trying to talk to you
But it's alright
Yeah, I'll put it on one side
'Cause everybody's looking
You've got control of everyone's eyes, including mine"
Riot Van,Arctic Monkeys,"Up rolls a riot van
And sparks excitement in the boys
But the policemen look annoyed
Perhaps these are ones they should avoid

Got a chase last night from men with truncheons dressed in hats
We didn't do that much wrong, still ran away though for the laugh, just for the laugh

""And please just stop talking
'Cause they won't find us if you do.
Oh, those silly boys in blue.
Well, they won't catch me and you.""

""Have you been drinking, son? You don't look old enough to me.""
""I'm sorry, officer, is there a certain age you're supposed to be? 'Cause nobody told me.""

And up rolls the riot van
And these lads just wind the coppers up
They ask why they don't catch proper crooks
They get their address and their names took
But they couldn't care less

Thrown in the riot van
And all the coppers kicked him in
And there was no way he could win
Just had to take it on the chin"
Red Light Indicates Doors Are Secured,Arctic Monkeys,"We'll ask if we can have six in
If not we'll have to have two
Well, you're coming up at our end aren't you?
So I'll get one with you
Won't he let us have six in?
Especially not with the food
He could have just told us no, though
He didn't have to be rude
You see her with the green dress?
She talked to me at the bar
Well how come it's already two-pound fifty?
We've only gone about a yard
Didn't you see she were gorgeous?
She were beyond belief
But this lad at the side drinking his Smirnoff Ice
Came and paid for her Tropical Reef

And I'm sitting going backwards
And I didn't want to leave
I said ""It's High Green, mate
Via Hillsborough, please""

Well, how funny were that sketch earlier
Up near that taxi rank?
Oh no, you would have missed it
Think it were when you went to the bank
These two lads squaring up proper shouting
I were next in the queue
The kind of thing that'd seem so silly
But not when they've both had a few
Well, calm down, temper, temper
You shouldn't get so annoyed
Well, you're acting like a silly little boy
Oh, they wanted to be men
And do some fighting in the street
He said ""No surrender
No chance of retreat""

And so why are they in the taxi?
'Cause I didn't want to leave
I said ""It's High Green, mate
Via Hillsborough, please!""

Drunken plots hatched to jump it
Ask around, ""Are you sure?""
Went for it but the red light was showing
And red light indicates doors are secure"
Mardy Bum,Arctic Monkeys,"Well now then Mardy Bum
I've seen your frown
And it's like looking down the barrel of a gun
And it goes off
And out come all these words
Oh there's a very pleasant side to you
A side I much prefer

It's one that laughs and jokes around
Remember cuddles in the kitchen
Yeah, to get things off the ground
And it was up, up and away
Oh, but it's right hard to remember
That on a day like today when you're all argumentative
And you've got the face on

Well now then Mardy Bum
Oh I'm in trouble again, aren't I?
I thought as much
Cause you turned over there
Pulling that silent disappointment face
The one that I can't bear

Well can't we just laugh and joke around
Remember cuddles in the kitchen
Yeah, to get things off the ground
And it was up, up and away
Oh, but it's right hard to remember
That on a day like today when you're all argumentative
And you've got the face on

And yeah I'm sorry I was late
But I missed the train
And then the traffic was a state
And I can't be arsed to carry on in this debate that reoccurs,
Oh, when you say I don't care
But of course I do, yeah, I clearly do!

So laugh and joke around
Remember cuddles in the kitchen
Yeah, to get things off the ground
And it was up, up and away
Oh, but it's right hard to remember
That on a day like today when you're all argumentative
And you've got the face on"
Perhaps Vampires Is A Bit Strong But…,Arctic Monkeys,"I've seen your eyes as they fix on me
What is he doing
What on earth's the plan
Has he got one

You better give me some pointers
Since you are the big rocket launcher
And I'm just the shotgun

Well I ain't got no dollar signs in my eyes
That might be a surprise
But it's true
Said I'm not like you

And I don't want your advice
Or your praise or to move in the ways
You do, and I never will

'Cause all you people are vampires
And all your stories are stale
And though you pretend to stand by us
I know you're certain we'll fail

Well I've seen your eyes
As they fix on me
Full of confusion
Your snarl is just so condescending

Try to explain that we're on to a win
If the fee we get in
Near recoups what we're spending

He said I can't believe
That you drove all that way
Well how much did they pay you?
How much did they pay ya?

You'd have been better to stay round our way
Thinking about things but not actually doing the things

'Cause all you people are vampires
And all your stories are stale
And though you pretend to stand by us
I know you're certain we'll fail

'Cause all you people are vampires
And all your stories are stale
And though you pretend to stand by us
I know you're certain we'll fail

All you people are vampires!"
When The Sun Goes Down,Arctic Monkeys,"I said, ""Who's that girl there?""
I wonder what went wrong
So that she had to roam the streets
She don't do major credit cards
I doubt she does receipts
It's all not quite legitimate

And what a scummy man
Just give him half a chance
I bet he'll rob you if he can
Can see it in his eyes,
Yeah, that he's got a driving ban
Amongst some other offences

And I've seen him with girls of the night
And he told Roxanne to put on her red light
They're all infected but he'll be alright
'Cause he's a scumbag, don't you know?
I said he's a scumbag, don't you know?

Although you're trying not to listen
Avert your eyes and staring at the ground
She makes a subtle proposition,
""I'm sorry, love, I'll have to turn you down""

He must be up to something
What are the chances? Sure it's more than likely
I've got a feeling in my stomach
I start to wonder what his story might be
What his story might be, yeah

'Cause they said it changes when the sun goes down
Yeah, they said it changes when the sun goes down
They said it changes when the sun goes down
Around here
Around here

Look here comes a Ford Mondeo
Isn't he Mister Inconspicuous?
And he don't even have to say 'owt
She's in the stance ready to get picked up

Bet she's delighted when she sees him
Pulling in and giving her the eye
Because she must be fucking freezing
Scantily clad beneath the clear night sky
It doesn't stop in the winter, no

And they said it changes when the sun goes down
Yeah, they said it changes when the sun goes down
And they said it changes when the sun goes down
Around here

Well, they said it changes when the sun goes down
Over the river going out of town
And they said it changes when the sun goes down
Around here
Around here

And what a scummy man
Just give him half a chance
I bet he'll rob you if he can
Can see it in his eyes that he's got a nasty plan
I hope you're not involved at all"
From The Ritz To The Rubble,Arctic Monkeys,"Last night these two bouncers and one of em's alright
The other one's the scary
And his way or no way, totalitarian

He's got no time for you
Looking or breathing
How he don't want you to
So step out the queue
He makes examples of you
And there's nowt you can say
Behind they go through to the bit where you pay

And you realize then that it's finally the time
To walk back past ten thousand eyes in the line

And you can swap jumpers and make another move
Instilled in your brain you've got something to prove
To all the smirking faces and the boys in black
Why can't they be pleasant?
Why can't they have a laugh?

He's got his hand in your chest
He wants to give you a duff
Well, secretly I think he wants it all to kick off
They want arms flying everywhere and
Bottles as well it's just
Something to talk about
A story to tell you

Well, I'm so glad they turned us all away we'll put it down to fate
I said a thousand million things that I could never say this morning
Got too deep, but how deep is too deep?

Well, this town's a different town today
Said, this town's a different town to what it was last night
You couldn't have done that on a Sunday

And, that girl's a different girl today
Said, that girl's a different girl to what you kissed last night
You couldn't have done that on a Sunday
Of course not

Well, I'm so glad they turned us all away we'll put it down to fate
I thought a thousand million things that I could never think this morning
Got too deep, but how deep is too deep?

Last night what we talked about
It made so much sense
But now the haze has ascended
It don't make no sense anymore

I said last night what we talked about
It made so much sense
But now the haze has ascended
It don't make no sense anymore"
A Certain Romance,Arctic Monkeys,"""Shall I keep rolling?""

Well oh they might wear classic Reeboks
Or knackered Converse
Or tracky bottoms tucked in socks
But all of that's what the point is not
The point's that there ain't no romance around there

And there's the truth that they can't see
They'd probably like to throw a punch at me
And if you could only see them, then you would agree
Agree that there ain't no romance around there

You know, oh, it's a funny thing, you know?
We'll tell them if you like
We'll tell them all tonight
They'll never listen
Because their minds are made up
And course it's all OK to carry on that way

'Cause over there there's broken bones
There's only music, so that there's new ringtones
And it don't take no Sherlock Holmes
To see it's a little different around here

Don't get me wrong though there's boys in bands
And kids who like to scrap with pool cues in their hands
And just 'cause he's had a couple of cans
He thinks it's alright to act like a dickhead

Don't you know, oh it's a funny thing you know
We'll tell them if you like
We'll tell them all tonight
They'll never listen
Because their minds are made up

And course is all OK to carry on that way
But I said no, oh no!
Well, you won't get me to go
Not anywhere, not anywhere
No, I won't go, oh no, no

But over there there's friends of mine
What can I say, I've known them for a long long time
And they might overstep the line
But you just cannot get angry in the same way
No, not in the same way
Said, not in the same way
Oh no, oh no, no!"
Brianstorm,Arctic Monkeys,"Brian
Top marks for not tryin'
So kind of you to bless us with your effortlessness
We're grateful and so strangely comforted

And I wonder are you puttin' us under
Cause we can't take our eyes off the T-shirt and ties combination
Well see you later, innovator

Some want to kiss some want to kick you
There's not a net you couldn't slip through
Or at least that's the impression I get cause you're smooth and you're wet
And she's not aware yet but she's yours

She'll be sayin' use me
Show me the Jacuzzi
I imagine that it's there on a plate
Your high rendezvous rate
Means that you'll never be frightened
To make them wait for a while
I doubt it's your style not to get what you set out to acquire
The eyes are on fire
You are the unforecasted storm

[Brian:]
Calm, collected, and commandin'
(Top marks for not tryin')
You leave the other story standin'
With your renditions and jokes
Bet there's hundreds of blokes that have wept cause you've stolen their ...thunder
Are you puttin' us under

Cause we can't take our eyes off the T-shirt and ties combination
Well see you later, innovator"
Teddy Picker,Arctic Monkeys,"They've sped up to the point where they provoke
The punch-line before they have told the joke
Plenty of desperation to be seen
Staring at the television screen

They've sped up to the point where they provoke you
To tell the fucking punch-line before you have told the joke
""Sorry, sunshine, it doesn't exist
It wasn't in the top 100 list""

And it's the thousandth time that it's even bolder
Don't be surprised when you get bent over
They told you, but you were dying for it

Saw it and she grabbed it and it wasn't what it seemed
The kids all dream of making it, whatever that means
Another variation on a theme
A tangle on the television and the magazine
Do you reckon that they do it for a joke?
Do you reckon that they make 'em take an oath?
That says that we are defenders
Of any poser or professional pretender around

When did your list
Replace the twist and turn like a fist
Replaced a kiss?
Don't concern us with your bollocks
I don't want your prayer
Save it for the morning after

And it's the thousandth time and it's even bolder
Don't be surprised when you get bent over
They told you, but you were gagging for it

Let's have a game on the teddy picker
Not quick enough, can I have it quicker?
Already thick, and you're getting thicker

Let's have a game on the teddy picker
Not quick enough, can I have it quicker?
Already thick, and you're getting thicker

Presuming that all things are equal?

D is for Dangerous,Arctic Monkeys,"He knew what he wanted to say
But he did not want to word it
The dirty little Herbert
Was thinking an escape
But the place was well guarded

The guiltyness that started
Soon as the other part had stopped

D is for Delightful
And try and keep your trousers on
I think you should know you're his favourite worst nightmare
D is for...

Desperately trying to stimulate what it was that was alright
3 quarters of an hour ago
That had led him to be in a position
And every compromission
Another freak episode

He's nearing the brink but he thinks first
The parallel universe perhaps could be the perfect scene
He's nearing the brink but he thinks first
The parallel universe perhaps could be the perfect scene

Balaclava,Arctic Monkeys,"Running off over next door's garden
Before the hour is done
It's more a question of feeling
Than it is a question of fun

The confidence is the balaclava
I'm sure you'll baffle 'em good
With the ending reek of salty cheeks
And runny make-up alone

Or will blood run down the face
Of a boy bewildered and scorned
And you'll find yourself in a skirmish
Where you'll wish you'd never been born

You tie yourself to the tracks
And there isn't no going back
And it's wrong wrong wrong
But we'll do it anyway
'Cause we love a bit of trouble

Are you pulling her from a burning building
Or throwing her to the sharks
Can only hope that the ending is as pleasurable as the start

The confidence is the balaclava,
I'm sure you baffle 'em straight
And it's wrong wrong wrong,
She can hardly wait

That's right,
He won't let her out his sight
Now the shaggers perform
And the daggers are drawn
Who's the crooks in this crime?

That's right,
He won't let her out his sight
Now the shaggers perform
And the daggers are drawn
Who's the crooks in this crime!

That's right,
He won't let her out his sight
That's right,
He won't let her out his sight
That's right,
He won't let her out his sight

Will you be able to boast
Of the day of the most
Flawless heist of all time

You knew that it'd be trouble
Right before the very first kiss
Quiet, unassuming,
But you heard that they were the naughtiest

She pleaded with you to take it off
But you resisted and fought
But sorry, sweetheart, I'd much rather
Keep on the balaclava."
Fluorescent Adolescent,Arctic Monkeys,"You used to get it in your fishnets
Now you only get it in your night dress
Discarded all the naughty nights for niceness
Landed in a very common crisis

Everything's in order in a black hole
Nothing seems as pretty as the past though
That Bloody Mary's lacking in Tabasco
Remember when you used to be a rascal?

Oh the boy's a slag
The best you ever had
The best you ever had is just a memory
And those dreams weren't as daft as they seem
Aren't as daft as they seem
My love, when you dream them up

Flicking through a little book of sex tips
Remember when the boys were all electric?
Now when she's told she's gonna get it
I'm guessing that she'd rather just forget it

Clinging till I'm getting sentimental
Said she wasn't going but she went still
Likes her gentlemen not to be gentle
Was it a Mecca dauber or a betting pencil?

Oh the boy's a slag
The best you ever had
The best you ever had is just a memory
And those dreams weren't as daft as they seem

Only Ones Who Know,Arctic Monkeys,"In a foreign place, the saving grace was the feeling
That it was a heart that he was stealing
Oh, he was ready to impress and the fierce excitement
The eyes are bright, he couldn't wait to get away
And I bet the Juliet was just the icing on the cake
Make no mistake, no

And even if somehow we could have shown you the place you wanted
Well, I'm sure you could have made it that bit better on your own

And I bet she told a million people that she'd stay in touch
But all the little promises they don't mean much
When there's memories to be made
And I hope you're holding hands by new year's eve
They made it far too easy to believe
That true romance can't be achieved these days

And even if somebody could have shown you the place you wanted
Well, I'm sure you could have made it that bit better on your own
You are the only ones who know"
Do Me a Favour,Arctic Monkeys,"Well the morning was complete.
There was tears on the steering wheel dripping on the seat,
Several hours or several weeks,
I'd have the cheek to say they're equally as bleak!

It's the beginning of the end, the car went up the hill,
And disappeared around the bend, ask anyone they'll tell you that.
It's these times that it tends,
The start to breaking up, to start to fall apart
Oh! hold on to your heart.

Do me a favour and break my nose!
Do me a favour and tell me to go away!
Do me a favour and stop asking questions!

She walked away, well her shoes were untied,
And the eyes were all red,
You could see that we'd cried, and I watched and I waited,
'Till she was inside, forcing a smile and waving goodbye.

Curiousity becomes a heavy load,
Too heavy to hold, too heavy to hold.
Curiousity becomes a heavy load,
Too heavy to hold, will force you to be cold.

And do me a favour, and ask if you need some help!
She said, do me a favour and stop flattering yourself!
How to tear apart the ties that bind, perhaps 'fuck off' might be too kind,
Perhaps 'fuck off' might be too kind"
This House is a Circus,Arctic Monkeys,"This house is a circus, berserk as fuck

There's a,

Room full of trouble and there's lovers to be had
Those ones who make sinners out of such lovely lads
Scaling the corridors for maidens in the maze
And the anomaly is slipping to familiar ways

And we're forever unfulfilled
Can't think why
Like a search for murder clues
In dead man's eyes
Forever unfulfilled
And can't think why
Like a search for murder clues
In dead man's eyes

The more you open your mouth
The more you're forcing performance
And all the attention is leading me to feel important (completely obnoxious)
Now that we're here, we may as well go too far

Wriggling around and it's so that you won't forget
There's certainly some venom in the looks that you collect
Aimlessly gazing at the faces in the queue
Struggling with the notion that it's life not film

"If You Were There, Beware",Arctic Monkeys,"If you were there, beware
The serpent soul pinchers
Three hundred and fifty no thank yous and nobody flinches
Go on girl go on, give us something gruesome
We require your grief, the thugs help the thieves
As they're trying to rob the words from her gob and
Take the source of the innocents

If you were there, beware
The serpent soul pinchers
Can't you sense she was never meant
To fill column inches
And you've had enough, what you're trying to dig up
Isn't there to be dug, the thieves help the thugs
As they're trying to beat the good grace of a sweetheart

Out to the point she'll comply

Why leave her on her own
If I'd have known then I wouldn't have said it
I wouldn't have said it if I would have known
Why leave her on her own
If I predicted tears then I wouldn't have said it
I wouldn't have said it if I would have known

There's a circle of witches, ambitiously vicious they are
Our attempts to remind them of reason won't get us that far
I don't know what it is that they want
I don't know what it is that they want
But I haven't got it to give

The Bad Thing,Arctic Monkeys,"Do the bad thing
Take off your wedding ring
But it won't make it that much easier, it might make it worse

Oh the night's like a whirlwind
Somebody's girlfriend's talkin' to me but it's alright
She's saying that he's not gonna slap me or try to attack me
He's not the jealous type
And I only need to get half an excuse and I'm away
But when there's no excuses that's much easier to say
I've been before
And all these capers make her too forward to ignore
Well, she's talking but I'm not entirely sure, oh

Do the bad thing
Take off your wedding ring
But it won't make it that much easier, it might make it worse

Oh I'm stood at the bar and somebody's partner's talking to me
But I don't know that is what she isn't she murmurs things to confirm
That the tragedy is true
And I knew 'how could she could have anyone she wants
And I'm struggling to think of an immediate response

Like I don't mind
Be a big mistake
For you to wait
And let me waste your time
Really love it's fine
Really love it's fine

And then the first time it occurred that there was something to destroy

I knew before the invitation that there was this ploy
Oh but she carried on suggesting, a struggle to refuse
She said, ""It's the red wine this time,"" but that is no excuse"

Who wants to sleep in a city that never wakes up,
Blinded by nostalgia?
Who wants to sleep in a city that never wakes up?

She was enraged by the way,
That the emperor put traps in the cage,
And the days she deemed dull,
Lead to nights reading beer bottles,

You're such a fugitive,
But you don't know what you're running from,
You can't kid us,
And you couldn't trick anyone,
Houdini, love you don't know what you're running away from,

Who wants to sleep in a city that never wakes up,
Blinded by nostalgia?
Who wants to sleep in a city that never wakes up?

You're at a loss,
Just because,
It wasn't all that you thought it was,

You are a fugitive but you don't know what you're running away from,

She said, ""I want to sleep in a city that never wakes up
And revel in nostalgia.""
I know I said, ""Who wants to sleep in a city that never wakes up?"" but
Dorothy was right though"
505,Arctic Monkeys,"I'm going back to 505
If it's a 7-hour flight or a 45-minute drive
In my imagination you're waiting lying on your side
With your hands between your thighs

Stop and wait a sec
Oh when you look at me like that my darling
What did you expect?
I'd probably still adore you with your hands around my neck
Or I did last time I checked

Not shy of a spark
A knife twists at the thought that I should fall short of the mark
Frightened by the bite though it's no harsher than the bark
Middle of adventure, such a perfect place to start

I'm going back to 505
If it's a 7-hour flight or a 45-minute drive
In my imagination you're waiting lying on your side
With your hands between your thighs

But I crumble completely when you cry
It seems like once again you've had to greet me with ""Goodbye""
I'm always just about to go and spoil a surprise
Take my hands off of your eyes too soon

I'm going back to 505
If it's a 7-hour flight or a 45-minute drive
In my imagination you're waiting lying on your side
With your hands between your thighs

...and a smile"
My Propeller,Arctic Monkeys,"If you can summon the strength, tow me
I can't hold down the urgency
You've got to make your descent slowly
And oil up those sticky keys

Coax me out my low and have a spin of my propeller

It's a necessary evil
No cause for emergency
Borrowed the beak off a bald eagle
Oh, momentary synergy

Coax me out my low
Sink in to tomorrow
Coax me out my low and have a spin of my propeller

My propeller won't spin and I can't get it started on my own
When are you arriving?
My propeller won't spin and I can't get it started on my own
When are you arriving?
My propeller won't spin and I can't get it started on my own
When are you arriving?
My propeller"
Crying Lightning,Arctic Monkeys,"Outside the café by the cracker factory
You were practicing a magic trick
And my thoughts got rude
As you talked and chewed
On the last of your pick'n'mix

Said, ""You're mistaken if you're thinking that I haven't been called 'cold' before""
As you bit into your strawberry lace
And offered me your attention in the form of a gobstopper
It's all you had left and it was going to waste

Your past times consisted of the strange
And twisted and deranged
And I loved that little game you had called ""Crying Lightning""
And how you like to aggravate the ice-cream man on rainy afternoons

The next time that I caught my own reflection
It was on its way to meet you
Thinking of excuses to postpone
You never looked like yourself from the side
But your profile could not hide
The fact you knew I was approaching your throne

With folded arms you occupied the bench like toothache
Stood and puffed your chest out like you'd never lost a war
And though I tried so not to suffer the indignity of a reaction
There was no cracks to grasp or gaps to claw

And your past times consisted of the strange
And twisted and deranged
And I hate that little game you had called ""Crying Lightning""
And how you like to aggravate the icky man on rainy afternoons

Uninviting
But not half as impossible as everyone assumes
You are crying lightning

Your past times consisted of the strange
Twisted and deranged
And I hate that little game you had called ""Crying Lightning""
""Crying Lightning""
""Crying Lightning""
""Crying Lightning""

Your past times consisted of the strange,
And twisted and deranged
And I hate that little game you had called ""Crying..."""
Dangerous Animals,Arctic Monkeys,"I'm pinned down by the dark

Been fighting with my sheets and nearly crying in my sleep
Yes, I'm battling that well told gripe
The most frustrating type
You should have racing stripes the way you keep me in pursuit
You sharpen the heel of your boot and you press it in my chest
And you make me wheeze
Then to my knees you do promote me

I'm pinned down by the dark

A-N-I-M-A-L
She makes my head pirouette more than I would be willing to confess
D-A-N-G-E-R-O-U-S

The light it fidgets through, the thoughts will soon revert to you
About as bashful as a tribal dance
The first and final chance
And of course the audience of frighteners and fiends
Divided up into two teams
When the acrobat fell off the beam she broke everyone's heart.

I'm pinned down by the dark

A-N-I-M-A-L
She makes my head pirouette more than I would be willing to confess

Secret Door,Arctic Monkeys,"Fools on parade cavort and carry on
For waiting eyes
That you would rather be beside than in front of
But she's never been the kind to be hollowed by the stares

She swam out of tonight's phantasm
Grabbed my hand and made it very clear
There's absolutely nothing for us here
It's a magnolia celebration
To be attempted on a Wednesday night
It's better than to get a reputation
As a miserable little tyke
At least that's the conclusion
She came to in this overture

The secret door swings behind us
She's saying nothing
She's just giggling along

Her arms were folded most indignant
Not looking like she was soon to leave
I had to squint in order to believe
And then like a butler pushing on a bookshelf
And unveiling the unexpected
I, who was earlier reluctant, was suddenly embarrassed and corrected
How could such a creature
Survive in such a habitat

The secret door swings behind us
She's saying nothing
She's just giggling along
And even if they were to find us
I wouldn't notice, I'm completely occupied

As all the fools on parade
Cavort and carry on for waiting eyes
Ones you would rather be beside than in front of
But she's never been the kind
To be hollowed by the stares
Fools on parade
Frolic and fuck about to make a gaze
Turn to a scribble on a page by a picture
That holds her absence
But you're daft to think she'd care

Fools on parade [3x]
Conduct a sing-along"
Potion Approaching,Arctic Monkeys,"I was biting the time zone
And we embellished the banks of our bloodstreams
And threw caution to the colourful
Then we fell asleep in the car
Until the bumps woke me up in your grip
And the tide took me to your mouth
And then swept me back down to your palms

It's them that put me inside the reminder
That yours is the only ocean
(Yours is the only ocean)
That I want to swing from
Yours is the only ocean
That I want to hang on

I've got this ego mechanic
She's always trying to give me vitamins
Oh she'd be frightened of your reflection
I preferred her as a cartoon
If I could be someone else for a week
I'd still spend it chasing after you
Cos she's not shattering my attitude
No matter how she folds the potion

Yours is the only ocean
That I want to swing from
Yours is the only ocean
That I want to hang on to

I'm swinging on
Yours is the only ocean
Yours is the only ocean
Yours is the only ocean
Yours is the only ocean

We really ought to think it through
Would you like me to build you a go kart?"
Fire And The Thud,Arctic Monkeys,"You showed me my tomorrow
Beside a box of matches
A welcome threatening stir

My hopes of being stolen
Might just ring true
Depends who you prefer

But if it's true you're gonna run away
Tell me where, I'll meet you there

Am I snapping the excitement
If I pack away the laughter, and tell you how it feels?

And does burden come to meet you
If I've questions of the feature that rolls on your dream reel

The day after you stole my heart
Everything I touched told me it would be better shared with you, with you

And now you're hiding in my soup
And this book reveals your face
And you're splashing in my eyelids
The concentration continually breaks
I did request the mark you cast didn't heal as fast
I hear your voice in silences
Will the teasing of the fire be followed by the thud?

In the jostling crowd
You're not allowed
To tell the truth
And the photo booth's a liar!

There's a sharpened explanation
But there's no screaming reason to enquire

I'd like to poke them in their prying eyes with things
They'd never see if it smacked them in their temples"
Cornerstone,Arctic Monkeys,"I thought I saw you in The Battleship but it was only a look alike
She was nothing but a vision trick under the warning light
She was close, close enough to be your ghost
But my chances turned to toast when I asked her if I could call her your name

I thought I saw you in The Rusty Hook, huddled up in a wicker chair
I wandered over for a closer look and kissed whoever was sitting there
She was close and she held me very tightly until I asked awfully politely
""Please, can I call you her name?""

And I elongated my lift home
Yeah I let him go the long way round
I smelt your scent on the seat belt and kept my short cuts to myself

I thought I saw you in The Parrot's Beak messing with the smoke alarm
It was too loud for me to hear her speak and she had a broken arm
It was close, so close that the walls were wet
And she wrote it out in Letraset
""No, you can't call me her name""

Tell me where's your hiding place
I'm worried I'll forget your face
And I've asked everyone
I'm beginning to think I imagined you all along

I elongated my lift home
Yeah I let him go the long way round
I smelt your scent on the seat belt and kept my short cuts to myself

I saw your sister in The Cornerstone on the phone to the middle man
When I saw that she was on her own I thought she might understand
She was close, well you couldn't get much closer
She said, ""I'm really not supposed to, but, yes, you can call me anything you want"""
Dance Little Liar,Arctic Monkeys,"I heard the truth was built to bend
A mechanism to suspend the guilt is what you will require
And still you've got to dance little liar

It's just like those fibs to pop and fizz
And you'll be forced to take that awful quiz
And you're bound to trip and she'll detect the fiction on your lips
And dig a contradiction up

And the clean coming will hurt
And you can never get it spotless
When there's dirt beneath the dirt
The liar takes a lot less time

I'm sure it's clear and plain to read
It's not an alibi you need just yet
Oh no, it's something for those beads of sweat
Yes that will get you back to normal

And after you have dabbed the patch
You'll breathe and then proceed to scratch the varnish off
That newly added calmness
So as not to raise any alarms too soon

And the clean coming will hurt
And you can never get it spotless
When there's dirt beneath the dirt

The liar takes a lot less time to decide on the saunter
Have you got itchy bones and in all your time alone
Can you hack your mind being riddled with the wrong memories?

And the clean coming will hurt
And you can never get it spotless
When there's dirt in between the dirt"
Pretty Visitors,Arctic Monkeys,"Trudging through the morning and the tramp with the trampoline under his arm, shifts past your whiskers so stark is the charm but the barking alarm waits coiled 'til the corner is turned

And the bicycle wheels all struggle to move round in your muddy mind blatantly caked and unwilling to wind uncooperative time so he sits on the springs 'til the muck goes dry

All the pretty visitors came and waved their arms and cast the shadow of a snake pit on the wall
All the pretty visitors came and waved their arms and cast the shadow of a snake pit on the

What came first the chicken or the dickhead?
Split sleep reaps rewards from ill fitting thoughts
And twilight forced you to go on a walk, your legs start running and your head gets caught

Canopy 19 is perfectly placed for the reasonably frightening fall from the aftertaste
You'll have to slip away I am unhappy to say, behold there's a crook in the hammock plays

All the pretty visitors came and waved their arms and cast the shadow of a snake pit on the wall
All the pretty visitors came and waved their arms and cast the shadow of a snake pit on the wall

Behold there's a crook in the hammock plays cruelly with the base of the scales
And fiddles with the feet on a balancing act
Gagged, bound and crafting a tale
Trailing wrapped in a gasp
Cruelly with the base and the scales
And fucking fiddles with the feet on a balancing act
She was gagged, bound and crafting a tale
Trailing wrapped in a gasp

The Jeweller's Hands,Arctic Monkeys,"Fiendish wonder in the carnival's wake
Dull caresses once again irritate
Tread softly stranger
Move over toward the danger that you seek

You think excitement has receded then the mirror distracts
The logic of the trance quickly reaches and grasps
Handsome and faceless and weightless your imagination runs

And now it's no ones fault but yours
At the foot of the house of cards
You thought you'd never get obsessed
You thought the wolves would be impressed
And you're a sinking stone
But you know what it's like to hold the jeweller's hands
That procession of pioneers all drowned

In the moonlight they're more thrilling those things that he knows
As he leads you through the grinning bubble blowers in the snow
Watching his exit was like falling off the ferry in the night

The inevitables gather to push you around
Any other voice makes such a punishing sound
It became laughter's assassin shortly after he showed you what it was

And now it's no ones fault but yours, at the foot of the house of cards
You thought you'd never get obsessed
You thought the wolves would be impressed
And you're a sinking stone
But you know what it's like to hold the jeweller's hands
That procession of pioneers all drowned

If you've a lesson to teach me I'm listening, ready to learn
There's no one here to police me I'm sinking in until the return
If you've a lesson to teach please don't deviate, don't be afraid
Without the last corner piece I can't calibrate, let's get it engraved

She's Thunderstorms,Arctic Monkeys,"She's thunderstorms
Lying on her front
Up against the wall
She's thunderstorms

I've been feeling foolish
You should try it
She came and substituted
The peace and quiet for
Acrobatic blood flow
Concertina cheating heart beat
Rapid fire

She's thunderstorms
Lying on her front
Up against the wall
She's thunderstorms

Here is your host
Sounds as if she's pretty close
When the heat starts growing horns
She's thunderstorms

She's been loop the looping
Around my mind
Her motorcycle boots give me
This kind of acrobatic blood
Concertina cheating heart beat
Rapid fire

She's thunderstorms
Lying on her front
Up against the wall
She's thunderstorms
In an unusual place
When you're feeling far away
She does what the night does to the day

She's thunderstorms
Lying on her front
Up against the wall
She's thunderstorms
Thunderstorms

Black Treacle,Arctic Monkeys,"Lately I've been seeing things
Belly button piercings
In the sky at night
When we're side by side

And I don't mean to rain on anybody's cabriolet
One of those games you're gonna lose
But you wanna play it just in case

Now it's getting dark and the sky looks sticky
More like black treacle than tar
Black treacle
Somebody told the stars you're not coming out tonight
And so they found a place to hide

Does it help you stay up late?
Does it help you concentrate?
Does it tune you in when you chew your chin?
Am I ruining your fun?

And you talk the talk alright
But do you walk the walk or catch the train?
You wanted it, you got it
But you don't want it now

Now it's getting dark and the sky looks sticky
More like black treacle than tar
Black treacle
Somebody told the stars you're not coming out tonight
And so they found a place to hide

And now I'm out of place and I'm not getting any wiser
I feel like the sundance kid behind the synthesiser
And I tried last night to pack away a laugh
Like a key under the mat
But it never seems to be there when you want it

Black treacle

The Hellcat Spangled Shalalala,Arctic Monkeys,"Just when things are getting complicated
In the eye of the storm

Off the tip of her tongue
It does a dozen somersaults
And leaves you supercharged
Makes me wanna blow the candles out
Just to see if you glow in the dark

Shalalala
Shalalala
Shalalala
Shalalala

Home sweet home
Home sweet home
Home sweet booby trap
I took the batteries out my mysticism
And put them in my thinking cap
She's got a telescopic hallelujah
Hanging up on the wall
For when it gets too complicated
In the eye of the storm

Shalalala
Shalalala
Shalalala
Shalalala

And in a Hellcat-spangled cavern
When your judgment's on the run
And you're acting like a stranger
'Cause you thought it looked like fun
And did you ever get the feeling
That these are things she's said before
Her steady hands may well have done
The Devil's pedicure
What you waiting for
Sing another fucking shalalala

Don't Sit Down 'Cause I've Moved Your Chair,Arctic Monkeys,"Break a mirror
Roll the dice
Run with scissors
Through a chip pan fire fight
Go into business with a grizzly bear
But just don't sit down 'cause I've moved your chair

Find a well known hard man
And start a fight
Wear your shellsuit
On bonfire night
Fill in a circular hole with a peg that's square
But just don't sit down 'cause I've moved your chair

Ooh... Yeah yeah yeah [x2]

Bite the lightning
And tell me how it tastes

On your rollerskates
Do the Macarena in the devil's lair
But just don't sit down 'cause I've moved your chair

Ooh... Yeah yeah yeah [x3]"

All My Own Stunts,Arctic Monkeys,"Caricatures of your wrecking ball gown
In my mind all the time

I wanna be in that damsel patterned alley
Where you go for a smoke

And sorrow slow dances
The phones are lighting up
Taking no chances
Close but never close enough

Been watching cowboy films
On gloomy afternoons
Tinting the solitude
Put on your dancing shoes
And show me what to do
I know you've got the moves

All my own stunts
High noon has changed its tune
Linking arms, sinking hearts

And sorrow slow dances
Around the edges of her eyes
Taking no chances
The last one out to win a prize

Been watching cowboy films
On gloomy afternoons
Tinting the solitude
Put on your dancing shoes
And show me what to do
I know you've got the moves

'Cause I'm from High Green
I'm from High Green"
Reckless Serenade,Arctic Monkeys,"Topless models doing semaphore
Wave their flags as she walks by and get ignored
Illuminations on a rainy day
When she walks, her footsteps sing a reckless serenade

I've been trying to figure out exactly what it is I need
Called up to listen to the voice of reason
And got the answering machine

The type of kisses where teeth collide
When she laughs, the heavens hum a stun-gun lullaby
Those twinkling vixens with the shining spiral eyes
Their hypnosis goes unnoticed when she's walking by

I've been trying to figure out exactly what it is I need
Called up to listen to the voice of reason
And got his answering machine
I left my message, but did he fuck get back to me
And now I'm stuck, still wondering how it's meant to be
Singing a reckless serenade, reckless serenade
Reckless serenade, reckless serenade

Reckless serenade, reckless serenade
Reckless serenade"
Piledriver Waltz,Arctic Monkeys,"I etched a face of a stopwatch
On the back of a raindrop
And did a swap for the sand in an hourglass

I heard an unhappy ending
It sort of sounds like you leaving
I heard the piledriver waltz
It woke me up this morning

You look like you've been for breakfast
At the Heartbreak Hotel
And sat in the back booth
By the pamphlets and the literature
On how to lose
Your waitress was miserable
And so was your food
If you're gonna try and walk on water
Make sure you wear your comfortable shoes

Mysteries flashing amber
Go green when you answer
But the red on the rest of the questionnaire
Never changes

I heard the news that you're planning
To shoot me out of a cannon
I heard the piledriver waltz
It woke me up this morning

You look like you've been for breakfast
At the Heartbreak Hotel
And sat in the back booth
By the pamphlets and the literature
On how to lose
Your waitress was miserable
And so was your food
If you're gonna try and walk on water
Make sure you wear your comfortable shoes

Ohh, piledriver"
Love is a Laserquest,Arctic Monkeys,"Do you still feel younger than you thought you would by now
Or darling have you started feeling old yet?
Don't worry I'm sure that you're still breaking hearts
With the efficiency that only youth can harness

And do you still think love is a laserquest
Or do you take it all more seriously?
I've tried to ask you this in some daydreams that I've had
But you're always busy being make believe

And do you look into the mirror to remind yourself you're there
Or have somebody's goodnight kisses got that covered?
When I'm not being honest I pretend that you were just some lover

Now I can't think of there without thinking of you
I doubt that comes as a surprise
And I can't think of anything to dream about
I can't find anywhere to hide
And when I'm hanging on by the rings around my eyes
And I convince myself I need another
For a minute it gets easier to pretend that you were just some lover

When I'm pipe and slippers and rocking chair
Singing dreadful songs about summer
Will I've found a better method of pretending you were just some lover?
Will I've found a better method of pretending you were just some lover?"
Suck It and See,Arctic Monkeys,"Your love is like a studded leather headlock
Your kiss it could put creases in the rain
You're rarer than a can of dandelion and burdock
And those other girls are just postmix lemonade

Suck it and see you never know
Sit next to me before I go
Jigsaw women with horror movie shoes
Be cruel to me cause I'm a fool for you

I poured my aching heart into a pop song
I couldn't get the hang of poetry
That's not a skirt girl that's a sawn off shotgun
And I can only hope you've got it aimed at me

Suck it and see you never know
Sit next to me before I go
Jigsaw women with horror movie shoes
Be cruel to me cause I'm a fool for you

Blue moon girls from once upon a Shangri-La
How I often wonder where you are
You have got that face that just says
""Baby, I was made to break your heart""

Suck it and see, you never know
Sit next to me before I go
Go, go, go
Jigsaw women with horror movie shoes
Be cruel to me cause I'm a fool for you"
That's Where You're Wrong,Arctic Monkeys,"A pussyfooting setting sun
Make a wish that weighs a tonne
There are no handles for you to hold
And no understanding where it goes

Jealousy in technicolor
Fear by name than love by numbers
Street lamp amber wanderlust
Powder in a blunderbuss

She looks as if she's blowing a kiss at me
And suddenly the sky is a scissor
Sitting on the floor with a tambourine
Crushing up a bundle of love
Don't take it so personally
You're not the only one
That time's got it in for honey
That's where you're wrong

All the old flames fastened on
Make a wish that weighs a tonne
There are no handles that you can hold
And no understanding where it goes

She looks as if she's blowing a kiss at me
And suddenly the sky is a scissor
Sitting on the floor with a tambourine
Crushing up a bundle of love
Don't take it so personally
You're not the only one
That time's got it in for honey
That's where you're wrong
That's where you're wrong
That's where you're wrong"
