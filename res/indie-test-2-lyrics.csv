West Hills - Abridged,The Killers,"I was born right here in Zion, God's own son
His Holy Ghost stories and bloodshed never scared me none
While they bowed their heads on Sunday
I cut out through the hedges and fields
Where the light could place its hands on my head
In the west hills

Free in the west hills
Free in the west hills

She's got two full-grown children, one still on the vine
And once I got to know him I loved him like he was mine
Some nights we drive up the mouth of the canyon
On hillbilly heroin pills
We get out and watch the sunset
Peaceful and still

And free in the west hills
Free in the west hills

When the sheriff kicked my door down
I was sleeping in my own bed
And the mess I got caught up in
Rained hard down on my head
They got me for possession of them hillbilly heroin pills
Enough to kill the horses that run free in the west hills
They got me for possession of enough to kill the horses that run

Free in the west hills
Free in the west hills

If this life was meant for proving
I could use more years to live
But fifteen in a guardhouse
That's more than I'm willing to give
And if there really is a judgement
When He pulls my chart
He'll reject my actions
But He will know my heart
And he'll prepare a place for me
Where happiness instills
And the light puts its loving hands on my head
Free in the west hills
They got me for possession of enough to kill the horses that run

Free in the west hills
Free in the west hills
Free, free in the west hills, in the west hills, in the west hills"
Quiet Town - Abridged,The Killers,"A couple of kids got hit by a Union Pacific train
Carrying sheet metal and household appliances through the pouring rain
They were planning on getting married after graduation
Had a little baby girl, trouble came and shut it down
Things like that ain't supposed to happen

In this quiet town, families are tight
Good people, they still don't deadbolt their doors at night
In this quiet town

When we first heard opioid stories, they were always in whispering tones
Now banners of sorrow mark the front steps of childhood homes
Parents wept through daddy's girl eulogies
And merit badge milestones with their daughters and sons
Laying there lifeless in their suits and gowns
Somebody's been keepin' secrets

In this quiet town, they know how to live
Good people who lean on Jesus, they're quick to forgive
In this quiet town

Now whenever I'm near the town I'll find some reason to give
And I will walk with the dead and the living where I used to live
And every time I see my parents in the prime of their lives
Offering their son the kind of love he could never put down
Well, part of me is still that stainless kid, lucky

In this quiet town, salt of the land
Hard-working people, if you're in trouble, they'll lend you a hand
Here in this quiet town

The first crop of hay is up
School let out and the sun beats down
Smoke billows from a Sunday train
That cries away from a quiet town"
Terrible Thing - Abridged,The Killers,"The parking lot is rammed with shotgun pickup trucks
At the Jones Rubber plant where all the guys end up
Beer-drinking boy scouts living life like they ain't stuck
On these quicksand streets with their girls in a sling
I'm in my bedroom on the verge of a terrible thing

Around here, we all take up our cross and hang on His holy name, But the cards that I was dealt will get you thrown out of the game
Hey momma, can't you see your boy is wrapped up in the strangle silk
Of this cobweb town where culture is king?
I'm in my bedroom on the verge of a terrible thing

I close my eyes and think of the water
Out at the Salt Creek when I was young

Down at Old Mill Park, half the town's in tow
To crown the Bathing Beauty of the rodeo
While her mother fights back proud tears a young cowboy gives the nod
The chute opens, bull draws blood, and the gift is accepted by God
The chute opens, bull draws blood, and the gift is accepted by God
In this barbed wire town of barbed wire dreams
I'm in my bedroom on the verge of a terrible thing

I close my eyes and think of the water
Out at the Salt Creek when I was young
I close my eyes and think of the water
Out at the Salt Creek when I was young"
Cody - Abridged,The Killers,"Cody says he didn't start the fire
His parents know he probably did
He's always playing with a light
He's just a different kind of kid
And Cody says He didn't raise the dead
Says ""religion's just a trick
To keep hard-working folks in line.""
He says it makes his stomach sick

So who's gonna carry us away?
Eagles with glory-painted wings?
We keep on waiting for the miracle to come
Pour down the mountain like a heaven-fed stream

Cody's always got one on the line;
He likes to walk 'em by the wrist
He does his pulling with his eyes
He does his talking with his fists
Bottle rockets on an August night
Raid the coolers in the trucks
If we're lucky we'll get loud and we'll drink
Whiskey from a plastic jug

So who's gonna carry us away?
Eagles with glory-painted wings?
We keep on waiting for the miracle to come
Fall from the firmament and give us nice things
Round and round it goes
Where it stops, nobody knows, nobody knows

So who's gonna carry us away?
Eagles with glory-painted wings?
We keep on waiting for the miracle to come
Roll down the mountain to the sound of sad strings
We keep on waiting for the miracle
For the miracle
We keep on waiting for the miracle
For the miracle"
Sleepwalker - Abridged,The Killers,"Hey, sleepwalker, don't you miss the way
Wildflowers paint the western hills?
Or the first autumn whisper mid-September brings
And the glowy excitement that it builds?

Everyone is afraid of something
Even the strongest man alive
Hey, sleepwalker, we went walking in the western hills
And we picked you wildflowers
You gotta open your eyes

Hey, dreamcatcher, come out and see the leaves
The mountainside's all watermelon red
Soon enough, they're gonna rust and fall
Leave the mountainside cold and bare
But when the longer days of sun appear
They'll be rising like an answered prayer and I know that

Everyone is afraid of losing
Even the ones that always win
Hey sleepwalker, when the mountain comes back to life
It doesn't come from without
It comes from within

The hills are barren, but we look for what's to come:
Sweeter skies and longer days of sun
When you wake up, I'll be standing in the line
To kiss your eyes and wipe the tears from mine

'Cause everyone is afraid of something
Even the strongest man alive
Hey, sleepwalker, Western Bluebells and Painted Cups are getting ready to rise
It's time to begin
It doesn't come from without
It comes from within"
Runaway Horses (feat. Phoebe Bridgers) - Abridged,"The Killers, Phoebe Bridgers","Oh my heck, so
Yeah, the youth stampede
I mean, that's a tradition for sure
Um, one year we were- it was raining all, like, stampedes
And this horse come out
And everyone, you know, said it was supposed to be the best
And it fell in the mud and
Mean, you could see its leg just totally snapped
It was just hanging there
And the girl, you know, laid do-
It was the saddest thing, I mean
I think most of the crowd was crying
She sat up and laid over her horse
And just cried and hugged her horse
And, 'cause she knew that
You know, that was her last moments with that horse

Small town girl
Coca-Cola grin, honeysuckle skin
Born beneath the ruddy sign of a strawberry moon
Small town girl
Shows up for her friends, crazy 'bout the bends
I was there when she first put away childish things

We had spring in our heels
Unwavering forces
Head first into the unknown

Like runaway horses
In a fever till the end
And every step is a silver prayer
In the face of a hard wind

You traded school
For wedding rings and rent, invitations sent
Of you and him by a barn out on the edge of town
Small town girl
Put your dreams on ice, never thinking twice
Some you'll surely forget and some that you never will

There was a promise in our stride
But we changed courses
Head first into the unknown

Like runaway horses
In a fever till the end
And every step is a silver prayer
In the face of a hard wind

Like runaway horses
It's a long way back home again
When every step is a silver prayer
In the face of a hard wind"
In The Car Outside - Abridged,The Killers,"I'm in the car, I just needed to clear my head
She's in the house with the baby crying on the bed
She's got this thing where she puts the walls so high
It doesn't matter how much you love
It doesn't matter how hard you try

We got a place with a fence and a little grass
I put this film on the windows, and it looks like chapel glass
But when she turns, it's like the shadow of the cross don't cast
No blessing over our lonely life
It's like waiting for a train to pass, and I don't know when it'll pass

But I remember when she used to set the room on fire
With her eyes, swear to God
It's like a flood of grief and sorrow from a haunted life
When she cries, like a train, it's a lot

I dropped a line to a flickering high school flame
We laughed about all the ways that our lives had changed
She's up the road, about 35 miles north
Got two little boys in school, just had a real bad divorce
And in a moment of weakness

I told her if she ever needed a helping hand
I would lend, swear to God
It's like the part of me that's screaming not to jump gets lost
In the sound of the train, it's a lot

Trying hard
Not to care
Swear to God"
In Another Life - Abridged,The Killers,"Is this the life you chose yourself
Or just how it ended up?
Is that the yard you pictured when
You closed your eyes and dreamed
Of children in the grass running through the sprinklers?
Being somebody's wife?
Or were you living in another life?

When will I make it home?
When I damn well feel like driving
Down these empty streets
That burn though our birthright

I passed a couple of kids holding hands in the street tonight
They reminded me of us in another life
Am I the man of your desire?
Or just a guy from your hometown?
Are these the arms that you saw when you
Pictured yourself wrapped around?
Baby, I can vouch for the hopeless dreamer
When you look at me, am I the man you hoped I'd be?

When will I make it home?
When that jukebox in the corner
Stops playing country songs of stories that sound like mine

I spent my best years laying rubber on a factory line
I wonder what I would've been in another life
In another life
In another life
In another life"
Desperate Things - Abridged,The Killers,"She was doing 60 in a 35
I hit the lights and pulled her over
When I reached the window of the driver side
There was blood from her mouth
Dry on her shoulder

I've never had much patience for guys that hit
For more than just obvious reasons
I asked if she wanted me to take him in
She laughed it off like lemonade

When you're in love
You can be blinded by your own heart
You'll bend your own truth
So twisted up you could justify sin

And when people in love
Are desperate enough
To abandon their dreams
People do desperate things

I've been taking lunch breaks at her work
When the restaurant ain't too crowded
She knows me and my wife got a little girl
We don't talk too much about it

The other night she met me way out west
Things went further than they should have
When she undid the buttons of her dress
I didn't stop her, but I could have

When you're in love
You can be blinded by your own heart
You'll bend your own truth
So twisted up you could justify sin

But when people in love
Are desperate enough
To abandon their dreams
People do desperate things

I know where he drinks most every night
It's our local hero sports bar
I've got him cuffed and sweating cold
In the back of my patrol car

You forget how dark the canyon gets
It's a real uneasy feeling
I've never had much patience for guys who hit
For more than just obvious reasons

When you're in love
You can be blinded by your own heart
You'll bend your own truth
So twisted up you could justify sin

But when people in love
Are desperate enough
To abandon their dreams
People do desperate things"
Pressure Machine - Abridged,The Killers,"Hope'll set your eyes agleam
Like four feet dangling in the stream
But the Kingdom of God, it's a pressure machine
Every step, gotta keep it clean
A mattress on a hardwood floor
Who could ever ask for more?
I'll get up and cut the grass
Ain't nothing wrong with working class

I, I don't remember the last time you asked how I was
Don't you feel the time slipping away?
It ain't funny at all
It's gonna break your heart one day

Keep the debt cloud off the kids
Only sunshine on their lids
Jiminy Cricket and Power Wheels
And memories of Happy Meals
Sometimes I look at the stars
And think about how small we are
Sweating it out in the pressure machine
Good till the last drop

Why don't you say little things?
Butterflies don't just dance on a string
It feels like you clipped all their wings
And every year goes by faster than the one before

We've had that treadmill now for months
I think she might've used it once
If I shut my mouth and keep the peace
She'll cook my eggs in bacon grease
Life'll grow you a big red rose
Then rip it from beneath your nose
Run it through the pressure machine
And spit you out a name tag memory"
The Getting By - Abridged,The Killers,"When I get up, she swears that she don't hear it
Says that I'm as quiet as a mouse
I comb my hair and throw some water on my face
And back out of the stillness of our house
Lately, my patience is in short supply
Nothing good seems to ever come from all this work
No matter how hard I try

You know I believe in the Son, I ain't no backslider
But my people were told they'd prosper in this land
Still, I know some who've never seen the ocean
Or set one foot on a velvet bed of sand
But they've got their treasure laying way up high
Where there might be many mansions
But when I look up, all I see is sky

Maybe it's the getting by that gets right underneath you
It'd swallow up your every step, boy, if it could
But maybe it's the stuff it takes to get up
In the morning and put another day in, son
That holds you till the getting's good
Green ribbon front doors, dishwater days
This whole town is tied to the torso of God's mysterious ways

Maybe it's the getting by that gets right underneath you
It'd swallow up your every step, boy, if it could
But maybe it's the stuff it takes to get up
In the morning and put another day in, son
That keeps you standing where you should
So put another day in, son, and hold on till the getting's good"
boy,The Killers,"Just give yourself some time

Head down, wrong fit
Big deal, that's just growing up
Untouched, sixteen, don't overthink it, boy
White arrows will break

The black night (boy, boy, boy)
But don't overthink it, boy (boy, boy, boy)

And when you're out on the ledge
Please come down, boy
There is a place that exists
Just give it some time
Drawn arrows unseen will fly

Heatwave, slow lane
A small town, only diesels dance
These streets weren't meant to house
Jet-fueled engine dreams
White arrows will blast the black night

And when you're out on the ledge
Please come down, boy
There is a place that exists
Just give it some time

Home-drawn arrows unseen will fly
And break the black night

But don't overthink it, boy
(Boy, boy, boy)"
Your Side of Town,The Killers,"If I could put my arms around you
Would you remember how it feels
To bask in the glow of my protection?
Stumble and fall head over heels
If I could only find the right words
I'd sweep you off your feet again
You cut the power, but mine is raging
A dreamer till the end

I'm hanging on your side of town
I notice when you're not around
Can't keep my cool, I'm burning inside
A broken heartbeat, barely alive

And it's harder to breathe
'Cause I couldn't make you believe
What's written in the heavens above
Can't be denied, it's bigger than love

The streets are dripping with decisions of a quiet kind
Hallucinations on the shoulder of the borderline
With my experience, I'm better off just backing down
Instead of tripping through the pages of your side of town

Serrated edges of the blade are scraping over the leather
I guess we couldn't keep it together
I thought we had it covered forever

I'm hanging on your side of town
I notice when you're not around
Can't keep my cool, I'm burning inside
A broken heartbeat, barely alive

And it's harder to breathe
'Cause I couldn't make you believe
What's written in the heavens above
Can't be denied, it's getting harder to breathe
'Cause I couldn't make you believe
What's written in the heavens above
Can't be denied, it's
Bigger than love"
Bright Lights,The Killers,"Standing in darkness
With empty hands
I still know how to use 'em but the miles made other plans
Running out of highway
Shorter on time
Feel the dead weight deepen and the devil comin' down the line

The dashboard shaking
I steady the wheel
And I make every turn by memory, by feel
Towards a black horizon
An unbroken dawn
Will this endless stretch of desert road get me back where I belong?

Will you turn the bright lights on?
Baby, turn the bright lights on
'Cause I haven't forgotten where it is I'm from
Look out your window for me, here I come
Will you turn the bright lights on?
Baby, turn the bright lights on
Put me back on the corner to sing my song
I'm a shoo-in tonight, turn the bright lights on

I carried my own weight
And then some too
There are things I would change, but it ain't worth going through
Maybe I'm tapped out
Or just plain old tired
Tonight the charge is reading low, but I'm still hard-wired

Will you turn the bright lights on?
Baby, turn the bright lights on
'Cause I haven't forgotten where it is I'm from
Look out your window for me, here I come
Will you turn the bright lights on?
Baby, turn the bright lights on
Put me back on the corner to sing my song
I'm a shoo-in tonight, turn the bright lights on

Turn the bright lights on

Will you turn the bright lights on?
Will you turn the bright lights on?
Will you turn the bright lights on?
Will you turn the bright lights on?
Will you turn the bright lights on?
Will you turn the bright lights on?
Will you turn the bright lights on?
Will you turn the bright lights on?
Will you turn the bright lights on?

Will you turn, will you turn
Will you turn the bright lights on?

Will you turn, will you turn the bright

You know I think it's gonna be alright
You know I think it's gonna be alright
You know I think it's gonna be alright
You know I think it's gonna be alright
Tonight, tonight, tonight, yeah

You know I think it's gonna be alright
You know I think it's gonna be alright
Just take me back and let me sing my song
Turn the bright lights on

Turn the bright lights on

Turn the bright lights on"
Is This It,The Strokes,"Can't you see I'm trying? I don't even like it
I just lied to get to your apartment
Now I'm staying there just for a while
I can't think 'cause I'm just way too tired

Is this it?
Is this it?
Is this it?

Said they'd give you anything you ever wanted
When they lied, I knew it was just stable
Children trying hard not to realize
I was sitting right behind you

Dear, can't you see? It's them, it's not me
We're not enemies, we just disagree
If I was like him, all pissed in this bar
He changes his mind, says I went too far
We all disagree, I think we should disagree, yeah

Is this it?
Is this it?
Is this it?

Can't you see I'm trying? I don't even like it
I just lied to get to your apartment
Now I'm staying there just for a while
I can't think 'cause I'm just way too tired"
The Modern Age,The Strokes,"Up on a hill, here's where we begin
This little story, a long time ago
Start to pretend, stop pretending
It seems this game is simply never-ending

Oh, in the sun, sun, having fun, it's in my blood
I just can't help it
Don't want you here right now, let me go
Oh, let me g-g-g-g-g-g-g-go

Leaving just in time, stay there for a while
Rolling in the ocean, trying to catch her eye
Work hard and say it's easy, do it just to please me
Tomorrow will be different, so I'll pretend I'm leaving

I feel so different now, we trained at A-V-A
I wish you hadn't stayed, my vision's clearer now but I'm unafraid
Flying overseas, no time to feel the breeze
I took too many varieties

Oh, in the sun, sun, having fun, it's in my blood
I just can't help it
Don't want you here right now, let me go, woo!
Darling, let me g-g-g-g-g-g-g-go

Leaving just in time, stay there for a while
Rolling in the ocean, trying to catch her eye
Work hard and say it's easy, do it just to please me
Tomorrow will be different, so this is why I'm leaving"
Soma,The Strokes,"Soma is what they would take when
Hard times opened their eyes
Saw pain in a new way
High stakes for a few names
Racing against sunbeams
Losing against fig trees
In your eyes

And I am
Stop
And go
In your eyes
See, I am
Stop
And go
In your eyes

Let's go

When I saw her for the first time
Lips moved as her eyes closed
Heard something in his voice
""And I'll be there,"" he says
Then he walks out
Somehow he was trying
Too hard to be like them

And I am
Stop
And go
In your eyes
And I am
Stop
Oh, darling let me go

Tried it once and they liked it
And tried to hide it
Says, ""I've been doing this twenty-five years""
Well, I'm not listening no more
And these friends, they keep asking for more
Oh, yeah, oh, but that's it"
Barely Legal,The Strokes,"I didn't take no shortcuts
I spent the money that I saved up
Oh, mama running out of luck
But like my sister, don't give a fuck
I wanna steal your innocence
To me, my life, it don't make any sense
These strange manners, I love 'em so
Why won't you wear your new trenchcoat?

I should have worked much harder
I should have just not bothered
I never show up on weekdays
And something that you learned yesterday
Drive you to work and you'll be on time
These little problems, they're not yours, they're mine
Come on, listen to what I say
I've got some secrets that'll make you stay

I just want to turn you down
I just want to turn you around
Oh, you ain't never had nothing I wanted, but
I want it all, I just can't figure out
Nothing

And all together, it went well
We made pretend, we were best friends
Then she said, ""Oh, you're a freak""
They ordered me to make mistakes
Together again, like the beginning
It all works somehow in the end
The things we did, the things you hide
But for the record, it's between you and I

Oh, I didn't take no shortcuts
I spent the money that I saved up
Oh, mama running out of luck
And like my sister, don't give a fuck
I wanna steal your innocence
To me, my life, it just don't make any sense
Oh, strange manners, I love 'em so
Why won't you wear your new trenchcoat?

I just want to misbehave
I just want to be your slave
Oh, you ain't never had nothing I wanted, but
I want it all, I just can't figure out
Nothing

And all together, it went well
We made pretend, we were best friends
Then she said, ""Oh, I can wait""

Someday,The Strokes,"In many ways, they'll miss the good old days
Someday, someday
Yeah, it hurts to say, but I want you to stay
Sometimes, sometimes
When we was young, oh man, did we have fun
Always, always
Promises, they break before they're made
Sometimes, sometimes

Oh, Maya says I'm lacking in depth
I will do my best
You say you wanna stand by my side
Darling, your head's not right
I see alone we stand; together we fall apart
Yeah, I think I'll be alright
I'm working so I won't have to try so hard
Tables, they turn sometimes
Oh, someday
No, I ain't wasting no more time

Trying, trying

And now my fears, they come to me in threes
So I sometimes
Say, ""Fate, my friend, you say the strangest things
I find sometimes""

Oh, Maya says I'm lacking in depth
Shit, I will try my best
You say you wanna stay by my side
Darling, your head's not right
I see alone we stand; together we fall apart
Yeah, I think I'll be alright
I'm working so I won't have to try so hard

"Alone, Together",The Strokes,"No choice now, it's too late
Let him go, he gave up
I gave up
Lisa said, ""Take time for me""
Dropping him down to his knees
Ah, chest down

Take me away
See I've got to explain
Things, they have changed
In such a permanent way
Life seems unreal
Can we go back to your place?
Oh, ""You drink too much""
Makes me drink just the same

People tried. Felt so right
Giving themselves good advice
Looking down sometimes felt nice

He knows it's justified to kill to survive
He then, in dollars, makes more dead than alive
Let's suck more blood, let's run three hours a day
The world is over but I don't care
'Cause

I am with you
Now I've got to explain
Things, they have changed
In such a permanent way
Life seems unreal
Can we go back to your place?
""You drink too much""

The first time, it happened too fast
The second time, I thought it would last

We all like it a little different"
Last Nite,The Strokes,"Last night, she said
""Oh, baby, I feel so down
Oh, it turns me off
When I feel left out""
So I, I turned 'round
Oh, baby, don't care no more
I know this for sure
I'm walking out that door

Well, I've been in town for just 'bout fifteen, oh, minutes now
And baby, I feel so down
And I don't know why
I keep walking for miles

And say, people, they don't understand
No, girlfriends, they can't understand
Your grandsons, they won't understand
On top of this, I ain't ever gonna understand

Last night, she said
""Oh, baby, don't feel so down
Oh, it turns me off
When I feel left out""
So I, I turned 'round
Oh, baby, gonna be alright
It was a great big lie
'Cause I left that night, yeah

Oh, people, they don't understand
No, girlfriends, they don't understand
In spaceships, they won't understand
And me, I ain't ever gonna understand

Last night, she said
""Oh, baby, I feel so down
See, it turns me off
When I feel left out""
So I, I turned 'round
Oh, little girl, I don't care no more
I know this for sure
I'm walking out that door, yeah"
Hard To Explain,The Strokes,"Was an honest man
Asked me for the phone, tried to take control
Oh, I don't see it that way
I don't see it that way

We shared some ideas
All obsessed with fame, says we're all the same
Oh, I don't see it that way
I don't see it that way

Raised in Carolina
I'm not like that
Trying to remind her
When we go back

I missed the last bus, I'll take the next train
I'll try, but you see, it's hard to explain
I say the right thing but act the wrong way
I like it right here, but I cannot stay
I'm watching TV, forget what I'm told
Well, I am too young and they are too old
The joke is on you, this place is a zoo
You're right, it's true

He said he can't decide
I shake my head to say, ""Everything's just great.""
Oh, I just can't remember
I just can't remember

Raised in Carolina
She says, ""I'm not like that.""

When we go back

I say the right thing but act the wrong way
I like it right here, but I cannot stay
I'm watching TV, forget what I'm told
Well, I am too young and they are too old
Oh man, can't you see, I'm nervous, so please
Pretend to be nice so I can be mean
I missed the last bus, we'll take the next train
I'll try, but you see, it's hard to explain"
New York City Cops,The Strokes,"Ow! Haha, I meant, ah!
Haha, no, I didn't mean that at all
Ooh, ooh, ooh

Here in the streets so mechanized
Rise to the bottom of the meaning of life
Studied all the rules and didn't want no part
But I let you in just to break this heart
Even though it was only one night
It was fucking strange

Nina's in the bedroom, she said, ""Time to go now""
But leavin' it ain't easy, I got to let go, oh, I got to let go
And the hours, they ran slow
I said, every night, she just can't stop saying

New York City cops, but they ain't too smart

Well, kill me now 'cause I let you down
I swear one day I'm gonna leave this town
Stop
Yes, I'm leaving, 'cause it just won't work
And they act like Romans, but they dress like Turks
Some time in your prime, see me, I like the summertime but, hey

Nina's in the bedroom, she said, ""Time to go now""
But leaving, it ain't easy, oh, I got to let go, oh, I got to let go, oh
Trapped in an apartment, she would not let them get her
She wrote it in a letter, I got to come clean
The authorities they've seen, darling, I'm somewhere in between
I said, every night, she just can't stop saying

New York City cops, New York City cops
New York City cops, but they ain't too smart

Trying Your Luck,The Strokes,"You said you couldn't stay
You've seen it all before, I know
And sold you on their way
Oh, honey, that's okay

No harm, he's armed
Setting off all your alarms
When I find out
I hope it's you who set this trap

And store fronts rarely change

It lasts for just one night and then
I'm sorry that I said
That we were just good friends

No harm, he's armed
Setting off all your alarms
Entranced, I can't be here in time

She wanna be admired
You say, ""Please don't make this harder""
No, I won't yet

Did they offend us and they want it to sound new?

Reptilia,The Strokes,"He seemed impressed by the way you came in
""Tell us a story, I know you're not boring.""
I was afraid that you would not insist
""You sound so sleepy, just take this, now leave me.""

I said, ""Please don't slow me down if I'm going too fast.""
You're in a strange part of our town

Yeah, the night's not over, you're not trying hard enough
Our lives are changing lanes, you ran me off the road
The wait is over, I'm now taking over
You're no longer laughing, I'm not drowning fast enough

Now every time that I look at myself
""I thought I told you, this world is not for you.""
The room is on fire as she's fixing her hair

Automatic Stop,The Strokes,"So many fish there in the sea
I wanted you, you wanted me
That's just a phase, it's got to pass
I was a train moving too fast

Didn't understand what to see
Yeah, then I got a different view
It's you... no

We could go and get forties
Fuck going to that party
Oh really, your folks are away now?
Alright, let's go, you convinced me

12:51 is the time my voice
Found the words I sought
Is it this stage I want?
The world is shutting out for us
Oh, we were tense for sure
But we was confident

Kiss me now that I'm older
I won't try to control you

You Talk Way Too Much,The Strokes,
Between Love & Hate,The Strokes,"Watched her as she wiped her eyes
You don't make me sorry
Now I know that you never listened – listen
Thinking about that high school dance
Worrying about the finals

But you know I can't give up – give up
P.S. If I may ask why, when will they get tired?
We've stayed up all night trying – trying

Meet Me in the Bathroom,The Strokes,"When they say promises, they mean promises
They'd say, ""That's OK, long as we can celebrate""

Things would change when he's dead
""Meet me in the bathroom"", that's what she said
I don't mind, it's true, hey

Never was on time, yes, I once was mine
Well, that was long ago and, darling, I don't mind
Yeah, we were just two friends in lust
And, baby, that just don't mean much

After you showed me what it was

The Way It Is,The Strokes,"She was still sleeping; the problem will stay
One more day
Said she's not sorry the wind blows her way
Accidents happen, there's one planned today
Oh you see

I wish it was not true
But that's the way it is
It's not your fault
That's the way it is
I'm sick of you
And that's the way it is
And will always be

Wednesday is over, it's over again
Said my goodbyes to the life we won't spend
Together

The End Has No End,The Strokes,"One by one, ticking time bombs won
It's not the secrets of the government that's keeping you dumb

One by one, baby, here they come
He wants it easy, he want it relaxed

I Can't Win,The Strokes,"That was you up on the mountain
All alone and all surrounded
Walking on the ground you're breaking
Laughing at the life you're wasting
One, two tries won't do it
You do it all your life and you never get through it
Everything they had to say
Had been erased in just one day

""Good try, we don't like it""
""Good try, we won't take that shit""
Oh, I can't win

Things in bars that people do
When no one wants to talk to you
Failing can be quite a breeze
He told me that these girls were easy
Happy that you said you'd mount me
Felt unlucky when you found me
Some nights come up empty handed
Yes, I'll take it

Wait now, by the sidewalk
Hold on, yes, I'll be right back
Oh, I can't win

Twenty ways to see the world, oh
And twenty ways to start a fight, oh

Juicebox,The Strokes,"Everybody sees me, but it's not that easy
Standing in the light field, standing in the light field
Waiting for some action, waiting for some action over
Why won't you come over here?

Why won't you come over here?
We got a city to love
Why won't you come over here?
We got a city to love

Old time grudges
Will die so slowly
I know you miss the
Way I saw you

You're cold, you're so cold
You're so cold, you're so cold

Nobody can see me, everything's too easy
Standing in the light field, standing in the light field
Waiting for some actress, waiting for some actress to say
""Why won't you come over here?""

Why won't you come over here?
We got a city to love
Why won't you come over here?
We got a city to love

Old time love song
Will die so swiftly
You never trust me
For a while, it was nice, but it's time to say bye

Heart In a Cage,The Strokes,"Well I don't feel better
When I'm fucking around

When I'm stuck in the ground

So don't teach me a lesson
'Cause I've already learned

I don't want what you want
I don't feel what you feel
See I'm stuck in a city
But I belong in a field

Yeah, we got left, left, left, left, left, left, left
Now it's three in the morning and you're eating alone

Oh the heart beats in its cage

All our friends they're laughing at us
All of those you loved, you mistrust
Help me, I'm just not quite myself
Look around there's no one else left

I went to the concert
And I fought through the crowd
Guess I got too excited
When I thought you were around

Oh, he gets left, left, left, left, left, left, left

And the heart beats in its cage"
Razorblade,The Strokes,"Oh, the razor blade, that's what I call love
I bet you'd pick it up and mess around with it
If I put it down, it gets extremely complicated
Anything to forget everything

You've got to take me out at least once a week
Whether I'm in your arms or I'm at your feet
I know exactly what you're thinking
You won't say it now but in your heart it's loud

""Oh no, my feelings are more important than yours
Oh, drop dead, I don't care, I won't worry,"" there you go

Oh, the razor blade, wish it would snap this rope
The world is in your hands or it's at your throat
At times it's not that complicated
Anything to forget everything

He would never talk but he was not shy
She was a street-smart girl but she could not lie
They were perfect for each other, say it now
'Cause in your heart it's loud

""Oh no, my feelings are more important than yours
Oh, drop dead, I don't care, I won't worry,"" hey

I loved you
Before I saw you

On the Other Side,The Strokes,"I'm tired of everyone
I know
Of everyone I see
On the street and on TV, yeah

Nobody's waiting for me on the other side

I hate them all, I hate them all
I hate myself for hating them
So I'll drink some more, I love them all
I'll drink even more, I'll hate them even more than I did before

On the other side, on the other side
Nobody's waiting for me on the other side

I remember when you came
You taught me how to sing
Now, it seems so far away
You taught me how to sing

I'm tired of being
So judgmental of everyone
I will not go to sleep, I will train my eyes to see
That my mind is as blind as a branch on a tree

On the other side, on the other side
I know what's waiting for me on the other side
On the other side, on the other side
I know you're waiting for me on the other side"
Vision of Division,The Strokes,"Sing me a song, you could be

I'll turn it to shit, happy and free, oh

All that I do is wait for you
All that I do is wait for you

I can't get along with all your friends

You know what to change but not in what way
How long must I wait? How long must I wait?
How long must I wait? How long must I wait?
How long must I wait?

I am not you, we could have
I'm almost through, great success
It's about time, such a success
That you came through, at no expense, oh

I've got nothing to say
I've got nothing to say
I've got nothing to say
I'm in utter dismay
I've got nothing to say

Harmless children, we named our soldiers after you
Don't be a coconut, God is trying to talk to you
We could drag it out but that's for other bands to do

I've got nothing to say
I've got nothing to say
I've got nothing to say
I've got nothing to say

I've got nothing to give
Got no reason to live
But I will fight to survive
I've got nothing to hide
Wish I wasn't so shy

I'd like to watch
I'd like to read
I'd like a part
I'd like the lead

But I've got nothing to say
I've got nothing to say

Electricityscape,The Strokes,"Oh, with strangers to impress so near
Old friends don't realize I'm here
I wish two drinks were always in me
I'd pretend I had the perfect ear

Take me to the water
Make me understand that I was wrong
For me, tomorrow is my first day
So please, don't tempt me in the wrong way

It's almost after midnight
I can see the city lights, we're here

Change your mind tonight
You belong to the city now
And you're closer now, I know
You belong on the radio

Well, I swear I'll give it back tomorrow
But for now I think that I'll just borrow

All the chords from that song
And all the words from that other song
I heard yesterday

Change your mind, tonight
You belong to the city now
And you're closer now, I know
You belong on the radio

I will not disturb you
I was just returning you the compliment"
Killing Lies,The Strokes,"Say a prayer now, don't be scared now
You don't want trouble, well, we might get some
We might get some, it's troublesome
But don't you worry, you can help me

Killing lies, killing lies
Killing lies, killing lies

First you're worried, then you're hurried
Don't think that everything is gonna stay the same
That's impossible, before I let you go, let me look at you
Don't you worry, you will help me

Killing lies, killing lies
Killing lies, killing lies

Oh yes, I noticed you, you are a friend of mine
Oh yes, I noticed you, you are a friend of mine
You're mine"
Fear of Sleep,The Strokes,"How did anybody find out where I was?
How did anybody find that out?
I was hiding from the world, I was a squirrel
But you chopped down my tree to get my fur

Fear of sleep, fear of sleep, the fear of sleep
Fear of sleep, fear of sleep, fear of sleep
Oh, fear of sleep, can't you wait? I'm not done
Fear of sleep, here you come
Fall asleep, fall asleep, fall asleep

You're no fun, you're no fun
You're no fun, you're no fun, you're no fun
You're no fun, you're no fun
You're no fun, you're no fun, you're no fun

I guess everybody's week must have been pretty rough
'Cause everybody is drunk, loud and pissed off
I know you hate to be impressed with someone else, other than yourself
But you know, trying to hold back on being an asshole helps

Fear of sleep, fear of sleep, fear of sleep
Fear of sleep, where'd you go? Fear of sleep
Oh, fear of sleep, so you know, I'm not done
Here we go, here you come
Fall asleep, fall asleep, fall asleep

You're no fun, you're no fun

15 Minutes,The Strokes,"It was all just a dream, oh no
Yet I wish it was real
All my pets they were there and they smiled
Take a shit, it was fine

Everybody so inviting
They've got it in for me I know
It's not that I don't really love you
It's just that I don't really know
The hateful things you think you want to say
Time will turn them into jokes, yep

Yes, it was all just a dream, oh no
Was it real? I don't know I hope so

Here we go. Can I play? Can I watch?
You would like one more night in your life
I saw worlds they don't stop, they're like us
They go fast, like a sun that's been shot

Everybody at the party
Shouldn't worry if I'm there
Everybody at the party
Shouldn't worry what they wear
'Cause today they'll talk about us
And tomorrow they won't care

This whole life
Is it a dream? I can't tell
I got up, then I waved, then I fell
I recall, you were all there with me
Overjoyed and at peace

First time around, second took so long
Third time's a charm, circle of fourths
Five days to rehearse, six to make it work
Seven notes in a scale, eight in some countries
Nine in fancy keys, ten is you and friend
Eleven seconds to hell, and of course twelve major chords"
Ize of the World,The Strokes,"I think I know what you mean but watch what you say
'Cause they'll be trying to knock you down in some way
Sometimes it feels like the world is falling asleep
How do you wake someone up from inside a dream?

Your mind would wander and search for its place in the night
Your body followed this feeling like following light
Once that your music was born it followed you 'round
And then it gave your activities meaning and let you be loud

You're sad but you smile, it's not in your eyes
Your eyeballs don't change, it's the muscles around your eyes

An egg to fertilize, a pulse to stabilize
A body to deodorize, a life to scrutinize
A child to criticize, young adults to modernize
Citizens to terrorize, generations to desensitize

Your dreams are sweet and obsessed and you're overworked
You're over taken by visions of being overlooked
How disappointed would D.I.D.I.P.P. be
To see such power in our hands all wasted on greed?
Am I a prisoner to instincts or do my thoughts just live as free
And detached as boats to the dock?

Just like the music was born and detached from your heart
Is your free time to free minds or for falling apart?
Night after night you turn off the light
You don't fall asleep, right away, are we, are we done?

A desk to organize, a product to advertise
A market to monopolize, movie stars to idolize
Leaders to scandalize, enemies to neutralize
No time to apologize, fury to tranquilize
Weapons to synchronize, cities to vapor-i(ze)"
Evening Sun,The Strokes,"They love you or they hate you, but they will never let you be
They'll thrill you or sedate you, but they will never let you see

In the evening sun
Amber evening sun

Encourage and derange you, watch you walking scared alone
Despite intimidation, pleased to watch you dance alone

In the evening sun
Amber evening sun

Go your separate way now
Someday you'll come back
And I'll be dreaming I was sunburned
I don't wanna break your heart in
Break your heart in two halves
Keep one half and give one half to me
I like the summer, miss the summer
Tell me, what'd you do? Nothing? Me, too

All actors they're pretending and singers they will sometimes lie
Kids are always honest 'cause they don't think they're ever gonna die
Oh, you're the prettiest, smartest captain of the team
I love you more than being seventeen

In the evening sun
Amber evening sun
In the evening sun"
Red Light,The Strokes,"Two could be complete without the rest of the world
Two could be complete without the rest of the world
Do it for the people that have died for your sake
An entire generation that has nothing to say
How'd you make your way to me?

Oh, let's say you made a deal with me
And I got your name and your home address
Oh, you're all trashed up with your big red belt
I would almost say that you might need help
I could drop you off at the next red light
If it don't make sense or it don't feel right
All the girls could never make me love them the way I love you

Can't you see the sky is not the limit no more?
I can see the elevator crash through the floor
I can still see yesterday, sailing away
Seven billion people who got nothing to say
Are you coming on to me?

Well, I saw your face, then I heard that song
It was so inviting, it hurt my bones
Well, it looks like you but your eyes are gray
And your hair is gone but your mind's okay
Yes, I like your smile but your forehead's cold
I don't want you to be afraid and go
I would cheat and lie and steal, now I'll stay at home and kneel for you

I was waiting for my baby to arrive
Right by my side
Oh, please, leave me alone tonight
Forget the past

Two could be complete without the rest of the world
Oh, you know I said it just to get you to laugh
Do it for the people that have died for your sake
An entire generation of entertainers to blame
The light is red, the camera's on

Get yourself a lawyer and a gun
Hate your friend's new friends like everyone
Childhood's end can be so competitive
Oh, the sky's not the limit and you're never gonna guess what is, oh"
Machu Picchu,The Strokes,"I'm putting your patience to the test
I'm putting your body on the line, for less
Didn't you know there was a choice?
It's never yours but someone else's voice

Sellin' your body to the street
Sending your girlfriends to the night, for cheap
Wearing a jacket made of meat
Sealing a letter made with horse's feet
And now you've heard that

Waves turn to grey
Life in the shade
A violent crime
And that's the USA
Platinum's on the rise
Sleeping in the sky
I'm just tryin' to find
A mountain I can climb

I'm putting your patience to the test
I'm putting your body on the line, for less
Didn't you know there was a choice?
It's never yours but someone else's voice
And now you've seen that

Blondes turn to grey
Life in the shade
A violent crime
And that's the USA
Porn's on the rise
Psychos in disguise
I'm just tryin' to find
A mountain I can climb

Darling, ain't nobody gonna tell us
They're gonna be oh so jealous
We're gonna be oh so silent
They're gonna be stoned in silence
(I didn't want to ask you, baby)
(I didn't want to have to ask anybody, baby)
(Is anyone asking maybe?)
(Can anyone even hear me?)

Why are you waiting beyond the door?

Life turns to dust
And rain turns to rust
Gossip is a truth
And money pays for the lies we trust
Your love is a surprise
Homeless saints are in disguise
I'm just tryin' to find
A nice place for you and I"
Under Cover of Darkness,The Strokes,"Slip back out of whack at your best
It's a nightmare
So I'm joining the army
No house phones, but can I still call?
Will you wait for me now?
We've got the right to live, fight to use it
Got everything but you can just choose it
I won't just be a puppet on a string

Don't go that way
I'll wait for you

And I'm tired of all your friends
Listening at your door
I want what's better for you
So long, my friend and adversary
But I'll wait for you

Get dressed, jump out of bed into a vest
Are you okay?
I've been all around this town
Everybody's been singing the same song for ten years

I'll wait for you
Will you wait for me too?

And they sacrifice their lives
And they lied about those odds
They'll say it a million times, and they'll say it again
So long, my adversary and friend

Don't go that way
I'll wait for you

I'm tired of all your friends
Banging down your door
Get up in the morning yelling, ""No more!""
So long, my friend and adversary
But I'll be waiting for you"
Two Kinds of Happiness,The Strokes,"Happiness is two different things
What you take and then what you bring
One is pleasure, one's discipline
One's devotion, one's just the ring

Desire and reward
Long term and short term joy

Don't waste your heart
Don't waste your heart

One has nothing to do with the other
And the world is all cousins not brothers

Hard to take you off of my love
One's an instant, one takes some will
One gives life, and one makes you kill
One's the means and one's for the end

Desire and reward
Long term and short term joy

Don't waste your heart
Don't waste your heart

One has nothing to do with the other
And the world is all cousins not brothers

Don't you give in
You're beginning"
You're So Right,The Strokes,"Tell me what happened, tell me what happened
Tell me what happened if you like

Get off on the same floor every night

What are the reasons? What are the reasons?
What are the reasons to find more?
I wanna tell you, I wanna tell you
I wanna tell you nothing more

In my mind, gave a hand
Never once, gave a damn

I'm done with the office, I'm done with the office
I'm done with the office, hello, forest
I still wanna ask you, I still wanna ask you
I still wanna ask you something more

In my mind, gave a hand
Never once, gave a damn

I don't wanna fight, don't wanna beg, you any-
I don't wanna fight, don't wanna beg, you any-
I don't wanna fight, don't wanna beg, you anymore

Taken for a Fool,The Strokes,"Sister, it feels like just yesterday
Sister, don't you forget my number
On this door?
You've got something and it's so good to see
Something wonderful that I could not be
Everybody hanging on for their lives
But you can't help them 'cause you don't have the time

I know everyone goes any damn place they like
I hope this goes over well on the toxic radio, yeah

You get taken all the time for a fool
I don't know why
You're so gullible but I don't mind
Oh, that's not the problem
And I don't need anyone with me right now
Monday, Tuesday is my weekend
You get taken for a fool all the time
I don't know why

Blame yourself for once, quit putting it on me
I can't help you 'cause I've seen what it means
It's so early, I don't want to wake up
Oh, we're so lucky 'cause we never grow up
Mama, it feels like just yesterday
Mama, don't you forget my number?
I don't want to be the one at the door

I know, everyone goes any damn place they choose
And I hope everyone well on the toxic radio
A tourist in the ghetto, not afraid of anything
Except death and anything else that could maybe hurt them, oh yeah

You get taken all the time for a fool
I don't know why
You're so gullible but I don't mind
Oh, that's not the problem

Games,The Strokes,"With all the noise above
He tried to call his name
The trial would go on
The day has just begun

Living in an empty world
Living in an empty world

The crowd behind went wild
They weren't all that proud
By now, they hear it loud

Living in an empty world
Living in an empty world

Living in an empty world

I'm OK, I'm alright
I was out late last night
Empty love
Empty love
I will wait one more night"
Call Me Back,The Strokes,"Wait time is the worst
I can hardly sit
No one has the time
Someone's always late

I look for you
And you look for me
Whoa, oh, oh, oh, oh

I don't know why
I came down
I hold your phone
Don't wake up
I hear a voice
In the ground

Tell me, don't tell me
The hard part is telling you
Something that you would not like me to tell you
Tell me, don't tell me
The hard part is telling you
Something that you would not like me to tell you

Wait time is to blame
Mapped out fame's a trip
We all have the time
Someone's always fed

I look for you
And you look away
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

I don't know why
I came down
I hold your phone
Don't wake up
I hear a voice
In the ground

Tell me, don't tell me
The hard part is telling you
Something that you would not like me to tell you"
Gratisfaction,The Strokes,"Oh b-baby, don't you be so mad because I barely remember
And she tries to recognize me with the eyes she saw me with in December
And she's starting to realize that it's actually not a good thing
And it's so tough because you're down to go out again and have another adventure
All her friends in the alleyway shout back, but she can't hear them

But you're never gonna get my love
We can only play in the sun
Get up in the morning and run
You'll be frustrated 'til the day that you're done

He got punched in the mouth for sticking his nose in other people's business
No good solution, always on the verge of some revolution
Well tough luck it may take a thousand years but I think we can do it
Best friends fight, but they never enjoy life as good as when they abuse it
He said, ""The soldier is a necessity in light of all the failures of man.""

But you're never gonna get their love
We can only fight in the sand
You get tired when the days are too long
You get lonely when the days are gone

He could never mention it out here and now
Without quick tears in his eyes

But you're never gonna get my love
We can only play in the sun
You get tired when the days are too long
You get lonely when the days are gone

Oh you're never gonna get this love
We can roll around in the dark
That's about as far as we go
Get up in the morning and run"
Metabolism,The Strokes,"I wanna be outrageous
But inside, I know I'm plain
So plain

Just plain
Boring and plain

Silently obsessed with death
Just like anyone, I guess
Trying for the perfect life
End up being in denial

I wanna be somebody
Wanna be somebody like you
Like you
Like you

Like you
Instead of me

Silently obsessed with death
Just like anyone, I guess
Trying for the perfect life
End up being in denial"
Life Is Simple in the Moonlight,The Strokes,"Animals on TV singing about some pain that they once felt
There's no one I disapprove of more or root for more than myself
I wanted to pretend that it was better, better, better on the phone
I didn't wanna tell you I was jealous, jealous, jealous and alone

So we talk about ourselves in hell
To forget the love we never felt
All the old jokes that work so well
Universal truth was a moment's lie

Don't try to stop us
Don't try to stop us
Don't try to stop us
Get out of the way

Got to get to climb your tree in the light of the living ghost I see
She sees her father in that old man's eyes while secretly he stares at her thighs
Animals on TV singing about some pain they felt at some point
I didn't wanna tell you I was jealous, jealous, jealous, what's the point?

As I watch the velvet drapes appear
And the door was closed for forty years
As we hide what we don't wanna hear
As we hide what's really in our ears

He is coming from a part of hell
Where lightning blue eyes don't go down well
He can tell that we're oblivious
It's addiction of routine as well
Making fools out of the best of us
Making robots of the rest of us
Innocence itself in America today
Is a crime, just like Cornel West might say

Don't try to stop us
Don't try to stop us
Don't try to stop us
Get out of the way"
Tap Out,The Strokes,"They found our city under the water

Didn't wanna know their name
Drifting
You don't wanna know what's going down
Even though I really like your place
Somehow, we don't have to know each other's name

All The Time,The Strokes,"Those that try anything once
Should we care about the only ones?

No one talks, about the war
On my block, or by the shore

All alone in a room
Do you want what I want too?
All the time in the world
Is all that's necessary

You're livin' a lie

One Way Trigger,The Strokes,"One, two, three

It's someone else's nothing
Here it comes now

You asked me to stay
You asked me to stay
You asked me to stay
But there's a million reasons to leave

Find a job
Find a friend
Find a home
Find a dog
Settle down
Out of town
Find a dream
Shut it down

Please, please don't point it that way
It's just a trigger that goes once and you'll be unafraid
I wish that I'd been noticed but it never goes that way
The silence that you brought has gone, gone, gone
Tell me, tell me, won't you understand?
Show me, show me, show me

You asked me to stay
You asked me to stay
You asked me to stay

Why my new friends don't seem to want me

Hurts my case, but that's okay
It hurts my case, but that's okay
We're dancing on a moonbeam
On and on and on and on and on

The deeper I get, the less that I know
That's the way that it go
The less that I know, the deeper I go
Juliet, I adore
The deeper I get, the less that I know
Diminishing returns
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

On, that's how it goes
All I wanna say
On another song
On another day
On another song
On another day
On another song
On another break"
Bad Decisions,The Strokes,"Dropped down the lights, I'm sitting with you
Moscow, 1972
Always singin' in my sleep
I will leave it in my dreams

Oh, makin' bad decisions
Oh, makin' bad decisions
Making bad decisions for you
Yeah, makin' bad decisions
Uh-oh, makin' bad decisions
Makin' bad decisions for you

Pick up your gun
Put up those gloves
Save us from harm
Safe or alone

Never listenin' to you

Eternal Summer,The Strokes,"This, and I never let it happen
Hey, yeah, oh
Hey, yeah, oh

When I think of you
It's always on my mind
Is that story true?
No one saves the day (Hey, yeah, oh)
Don't you want the truth?

Now that you heard the truth
All I need a friendly face
I hate that feeling too
But no one's unafraid (Hey, yeah, oh)
Don't expect the truth
This is a fantasy
I fight that feeling too
But nobody's gonna stop us now (Hey, yeah, oh)

Summer is coming, won't go away
Summer is coming, it's here to stay (Hey, yeah, oh)
Lo and behold the salt of the city
Pillars like time are fading away
Symphony building up to a future
Mystery to solve for somebody else (Hey, yeah, oh)

I can't believe it
Life is such a funny journey
Psychedelic
This is the eleventh hour
Hercules, your service is no longer needed
It's just like make-believe

At The Door,The Strokes,"I can't escape it
I'm never gonna make it out of this in time
I guess that's just fine
I'm not there quite yet
My thoughts, such a mess
Like a little boy
What you runnin' for?

Arrive at the door
Anyone home?
Have I lost it all?

Struck me like a chord
I'm a lonely boy
Holding out the knife
Lonely afterlife
You begged me not to go
Sinkin' like a stone
Use me like an oar
And get yourself to shore

A bang at the door
Anyone home?
That's just what they do
Right in front of you
Like a cannonball
Slammin' through your wall
In their face, I saw
What they're fightin' for

I can't escape it
I'm never gonna make it 'til the end, I guess

Struck me like a chord
I'm a lonely boy
Holding out the knife
Lonely afterlife
Bangin' on the door
I don't wanna know
Sinkin' like a stone
So use me like an oar

Hard to fight what I can't see
Not tryna build no dynasty
I can't see beyond this wall
But we lost this game
So many times before

I've been on a cold road
I'll be waiting, yeah
I'll be waiting from the other side
Waiting for the tide to rise
I've been on a cold road
I'll be waiting, yeah
I'll be waiting from the other side
Waiting for the tide to rise"
Why Are Sundays So Depressing,The Strokes,"I sing a song, I paint a picture
My baby's gone, but I don't miss her
Like a swan, I don't miss swimming
All my friends left, and they don't miss me

Can't take it, babe
Your body talks to me
Like in a movie, babe
I let it resonate, yeah

I want your time (Time, time)
Don't ask me questions (Questions, questions)
That you don't want (Want, want)
The answers to (To, to)

I love you and I'm honest, so you know it's no lie
You're hidin' in the background but you wanna be found
You've got me on my back and now I've gotta think fast
You're hidin' in the background but you wanna be found

I take it easy, babe, I
I get down, it's automatic, uh
I've come to believin' that
That too much time is evil

I transition in
I'm making your body wait
Like on an aeroplane
Please, baby, take me away, yeah

I want your time (Time, time)
Don't ask me questions (Questions, questions)
That you don't want (Want, want)
The answers to (To, to)

I know
I know
I know
I know

I kinda miss the nine-to-five, yeah
Do those things that you can't hide
I scramble, fight just like a child
Hey, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah
I'm staying hungry, I'm staying hungry
I'm staying hungry, I'm staying hungry
Not getting angry, I'm staying hungry
Not getting angry, staying, staying hungry
Yeah

Hold on, hold on, hold

It was never on
It was never on"
Not The Same Anymore,The Strokes,"You're not the same anymore
Don't wanna play that game anymore
You'd make a better window than a door
Oh, the strangers, they implore
It gets so easy to ignore
Just like the girl next door

Uncle's house, it was noon
Sorry, boy, I can't employ ya
You are strange, but I like you
Sorry, this is overdue
I promised I would do it right
Her and a boy on a Saturday night

And now the door slams shut
A child prisoner grows up
To seek his enemy's throat cut
(I'm on and on it, on and on and on it)
We're on the way, fuel the jet
Can see that what he wants, he gets
What does your sworn enemy regret?

I didn't know, I didn't care
I don't even understand
Did somethin' wrong, I wasn't sure
Stay on top of this, or else
I was afraid, I fucked up
Yeah, yeah, yeah
I couldn't change, it's too late

And now it's time to show up
Late again, I can't grow up
And now it's on me, they've given up

Uncle's house, I forget
Violent tendencies I get
Your timing sucks, she went overboard
Don't forget, you are insured
I didn't know, I wasn't sure
Can't remember all that well
I couldn't change, was too late
Yeah, yeah, yeah"
Ode To The Mets,The Strokes,"Up on his horse, up on his horse
Not gonna wake up here anymore
Listen one time, it's not the truth
It's just a story I tell to you
Easy to say, easy to do
But it's not easy, well, maybe for you
Hope that you find it, hope that it's good
Hope that you read it, think that you should
Cuts you some slack as he sits back
Sizes you up, plans his attack

Da-da-da
Drums please, Fab

And I got it all, I got it all
Waitin' for me down on the street
But now you gotta do somethin' special for me
I'm gonna say what's on my mind
Then I'll walk out, then I'll feel fine

Yeah, I'm under his thumb, I'm on his back
I will not show my teeth too quick
I needed you there, I needed you there
But I didn't know, I didn't know

Go alone
I'll go alone
We'll go alone
I'll go alone

Back from his trip, he's at the door
When he gets back, he's on the phone
Innocent eye, innocent heart
No, it's not wrong, but it's not right
Innocent time, out on his own
Not gonna do that, fuck, I'm out of control
I was just bored, playin' the guitar
Learned all your tricks, wasn't too hard

It's the last one now, I can promise you that
I'm gonna find out the truth when I get back

Gone now are the old times
Forgotten, time to hold on the railing
The Rubik's Cube isn't solving for us
Old friends, long forgotten
The old ways at the bottom of
The ocean now has swallowed
The only thing that's left is us
So pardon the silence that you're hearing
It's turnin' into a deafening, painful, shameful roar"
No Hope,The Vaccines,"Oh I could bore you with the truth
About an uneventful youth
Or you could get that rap from someone else
And I could make an observation
If you want the voice of a generation
But I'm too self-absorbed to give it clout

And I, I don't really care about
Anybody else when I haven't got my own life figured out
'Cause when you're young and bored and 24
And don't know who you are no more

There's no hope
And it's hard to come of age
I think it's a problem
Does it ever go away?
I know, I am so self-obsessed
I guess, but there's no hope
And I hope it's just a phase
I'll outgrow-oh-oh-oh

Oh I could look for inspiration
Find it in the charm of an English nation
But wouldn't that be cheap and ill-informed
And I could bet you don't believe me
If I said it came from deep within me
But I promise you I'm telling you the truth

And I, I don't really care about
Anybody else when I haven't got my own life figured out
'Cause when you're 24 and young and bored
And don't know who you are no more

There's no hope
And it's hard to come of age
I think it's a problem
Does it ever go away?
I know, I am so self-obsessed
I guess, but there's no hope
And I hope it's just a phase
I'll outgrow-oh-oh-oh

Well I wish that I was comfortable in my own skin
But the whole thing feels like an exercise
In trying to be someone I would rather not be
I tried to second guess if you would be approving
I find my life ever so moving
Keen, wide-eyed, and unassuming, hope

There is no hope, but there's desperately
No hope and there's definitely
No hope if you don't believe me
Oh
And there is no hope and there's desperately
No hope, and there's definitely
No hope if you don't believe me
Oh

And I, I don't really care about
Anybody else when I haven't got my own life figured out
'Cause when you're 24 and young and bored
And don't know who you are no more

There's no hope
And it's hard to come of age
I think it's a problem
Does it ever go away?
I know, I am so self-obsessed
I guess, but there's no hope
And I hope it's just a phase
I'll outgrow

There is no hope
I know it's a problem
And it never goes my way
I know, I am so self-obsessed
I guess, but there's no hope
And I hope it's just a phase
I'll outgrow, oh, oh, oh"
I Always Knew,The Vaccines,"Down, down in my bones
Somewhere I'd never have known
Right at the back of my head
It hit me like a beam of light
Hit me like a hook of the right
And I could have fell to the floor

'Cause you talk to me and it comes off the wall
You talk to me and it goes over my head
So let's go to bed before you say something real
Let's go to bed before you say how you feel

'Cause it's you
Oh, it's always you
Oh, I always knew
Oh, it's you

I try my best to unwind
Nothing on my mind but you

Oblivious to all that I'll owe
I'm hanging on to what I don't know
So let's go to bed before you say something real
Let's go to bed before you say how you feel

'Cause it's you
Oh, it's always you
Oh, I always knew
Oh, it's you
Yeah, it's you
Oh, it's always you
Oh, I always knew
Oh, it's you

Well, it's you
Oh, it's always you
Oh, I always knew
Oh, it's you
Oh, I knew
Oh, I always knew
Yes, I always knew
Oh, it's you"
Teenage Icon,The Vaccines,"Oh look at me, so ordinary
No mystery with no great capabilities, but
I could make out as if I had it, but you know
God I'm so obvious and I should let it go
Oh, I don't know, ooh

I'm no teenage icon
I'm no Frankie Avalon
I'm nobody's hero

Reserved and shy, your average guy
No piercing stare, just out of shape with messy hair but
I always figured I was somebody and wait
And now I'm guessing that my moment must be late
'Cause I'm here, ooh

I'm no teenage icon
I'm no Frankie Avalon
I'm nobody's hero

I'm not magnetic or mythical
I'm suburban and typical
But I got it, I got it
I'm overrun with it all

Seductive charm, a way with words
So effortless not leather clad or dangerous, but
I always did it like a real rebel would
I have a photo where John Lennon may have stood
Or so I'm told, ooh

I'm no teenage icon
I'm no Frankie Avalon
I'm nobody's hero

I'm no teenage icon
I'm no Frankie Avalon
I'm nobody's hero"
All In Vain,The Vaccines,
Ghost Town,The Vaccines,"I've been driving in my car
Trying to find some sign of life
No one's about and it's kinda creepy
It's an understatement to say it's sleepy

It's a ghost town where no one goes
It's a ghost town where no one goes

Well you think your town is pretty boring
Come and spend a day with me
I am asking real politely
I'm afraid to be alone

It's a ghost town where no one goes
It's a ghost town where no one goes

Apocalyptic, distressing, needs addressing and I'm guessing
Everybody likes to go... I know, I know, I know

It's a ghost town where no one goes
It's a ghost town where no one goes

It's a ghost town
Ghost town"
Aftershave Ocean,The Vaccines,"You have been struggling to see actuality
Actually, it doesn't surprise me
And you wearing wof frozen to the core
I'm not wearing anything awful

But you are pulling the wool over, wouldn't you rather know
That I am overindulging you, it's so easy though

You're coming up for air
Happier down there
In your aftershave ocean
Lies, difficult to face
Floating out in space
In your aftershave ocean

I could be talking out of line, you could put me straight
And I'd say I don't understand you
You'd say ""Oh, ignorance is bliss, come give me a kiss
Come give me a piece of your mind""

'Cause you are pulling the wool over, wouldn't you rather know
That I am overindulging you, it's so easy though

You're coming up for air
Happier down there
In your aftershave ocean
Lies, difficult to face
Floating out in space
In your aftershave ocean

Oh you are pulling the wool over, wouldn't you rather know
That I am overindulging you, it's so easy though

You're coming up for air
Happier down there
In your aftershave ocean
I get water up my nose
I have to dry my clothes
In your aftershave ocean
Lies, difficult to face
Floating out in space
In your aftershave ocean

Happier down there
In your aftershave ocean"
Weirdo,The Vaccines,"I know I'm fucking moody
And I know I'm quite unkind
I know I'm kind of distant
But you're always on my mind

And you will imply that I am apathetic
Right to the bone

And I don't wanna let it go
You know I'm not a weirdo, no
I don't wanna let it go
You know I'm not a weirdo

I guess I'm quite controlling
And I'm insecure
And I know you'd like it better
If I opened up some more

But I don't even know if I could look you
Straight in the eye (oh my)

And I don't wanna let it go
You know I'm not a weirdo, no
I don't wanna let it go
You know I'm not a weirdo, no

And I don't wanna let it go
You know I'm not a weirdo

I know that I'm neurotic
And I'm hard to please
And I'm disobliging
And faulty by design

Not withstanding
I think we could work out, work out just fine

Bad Mood,The Vaccines,"Better to be ready if you rattle my cage
Oh I should loosen up some, baby I know
But I get angrier with age
Better to be ready if you rattle my cage

Oh you look disappointed in me
Oh am I not as thoughtful as you thought I'd be?
Yeah I know I'm always giving you the third degree
But you look disappointed in me

Now I'm in a bad, bad mood; a bad, bad mood
I'm in a bad, bad mood; a bad, bad mood

We'll rate, generate, generate some more
So what you singing about summer for?
Forgive me if I'm untoward
And out of order but I suspect

That with respect to your perception
You're looking in the wrong direction
As I'm sure you'll conclude
I'm in a pretty awful mood

Better to be ready if you rattle my cage
And I know I'm always putting it on you
But I get angrier with age
Better to be ready if you rattle my cage

Now I'm in a bad, bad mood; a bad, bad mood
I'm in a bad, bad mood; a bad, bad mood

I'm in a bad, bad mood; a bad, bad mood
I'm in a bad, bad mood; a bad, bad mood"
"Change of Heart, Pt. 2",The Vaccines,"Do ya do ya do ya think of speaking your mind
Or is it openly as lonely as it is cold?
And do ya do ya do ya wanna get away
Or is it better off in the balance anyway
Later on or yeah whatever
I see now your beauty never ends

What the hell you do it's up to you
Now you've got to see it through
Tell the man you've had a change of heart

Do you make light of a bad situation
By burying your head under the sand
And eat the apple of your eye
Just because your mouth was dry
Oh well

Doesn't really matter what you need
But honesty is paramount
Just tell the man you've had a change of heart

Bullet hits the wall and you'll play along
Give someone a answer and they'll think of one
Find yourself somewhere you have never been before

You gave it time but to no avail
But now there's only XXX
Tell the man you've had a change of heart

You can bite the bullet
Or just do it in a minute
For the love of God if you've had a change of heart"
I Wish I Was a Girl,The Vaccines,"You walk into the room with refining and poise
Bewitching, enthralling all of the boys

You seductive mystery
You're a revelation to me
Life is easy when you're easy on the eye

I wish I was a girl

Possessive,The Vaccines,"I'm a man and I'm so possessive

Got advice, don't know what it was good for
Even now I don't know who I'm supposed to hate
Come to grips with the rules of attraction
And I don't know if you've ever liked me or not
Either way it was kind of convincing
You never learn, do you?

You cold headed but you worry alone
You could get in trouble but they already know
Ah oh, ah oh, ah oh, ah oh

You sat out and your covered in darkness

Immorality's a thrill
Even let it get the best of me

You put on your coat and smile
Saddest one I've seen for a country mile

When you were at the gate soaked through
Let's not say a word if it isn't true

Bloomsday

Cordoned off the rest, too young
Looking for a thing no do-er's done
We won't find it here my love

Once more

When you were at the gate soaked through
Never said a word that wasn't true

Heard you lied to the Major, won't be long
Well I wish upon a wedding for a picture in the star
When they knock for ya don't forget who you are
Skinty Fia

Baby, come on whose side are you on?
I don't wanna see the queen, I already sing her song
While they're snuffing out hopes and they're blotting out suns
They claim to know the form in which genius comes, yeah

Baby, come on get your high heels on
It's the body is cold, it's the course is run
What artless living all this soft pain thrills
What calamities usher all our brilliance to the hills
Can you feel it?

Baby, come on get stoned, get stoned
Get inside it, inside it, inside it, inside
Get along, get along, get alone, get alone, get
Was it the weed or the moment that stoned ya?

Baby, come on get the hourglass on

The Couple Across The Way,Fontaines D.C.,"Babe, it feels like it's all happened
Twenty-three years of the same
And I'm sorry 'bout this morning
For the damage I will pay

All the mirrors face the walls and
I wake just to long for bed
Love what's got you so down low?
The saddest tongue is in your head

I forget the thrill of lies
The truth escaping through the eyes, now
You use voices on the phone
That once were spent on me

The world has changed beyond our doorstep
People talk and dress so strange
I don't know a neighbour's name
And all of life is rearranged

Nice to know that you're still caring
Well enough to raise your voice
But if we must bring up the past then
Please don't speak to me of choice

Across the way moved in a pair
With passion in its prime
Maybe they look through to us
And hope that's them in time"
Skinty Fia,Fontaines D.C.,"Does you really don't know where the avenuers go?
Are you lying through your teeth or are they paying through your nose?
A set of manners and a smile is all they want you for
But we can talk about it later
You can read it in the paper

I hated you away from the very start
I seen you sticking to your smile, it's gone and broken my heart
Now the wind is making work of every step on the bridge
You say, ""I used to say we found each other, now I don't know
Where he is""

You get that feel, make your spirit shine
I let her prise apart my ribcage like a crackhead at the blinds
It hurt
But come the downing of the scrapyard sun
There is no light falls on our failure
It ain't covered in the paper

Well I really don't care what you think of me
But something gears me to the grovel every opportunity
I've got that jealous stripe
I probably am that type
I'll see you twenty Marys later
When your tongue is talking straighter

Heard he took 'em all down to the mercenary bar
I heard she broke up with her fella now he's drinkin' in his car
Nah
I'm not inclined towards the scandalous word
But on the subject of myself I do believe what I've heard

There is a track beneath the wheel and it's there till we die
She says, ""I don't agree with nothing"" I say, ""Neither do I""
Go to sleep
There's not a thing can't be fixed with a dream
And we can talk about it later
You can read it in the paper

I bet ya, I bet ya
You had your smile, you had your smile
For the open mile
I bet ya, I bet ya
You had your smile, your face defile

I Love You,Fontaines D.C.,"I love you, I love you, I told you I do
It's all I've ever felt, I've never felt so well
And if you don't know it, I wrote you this tune
To be here loving you when I'm in the tomb
I've eddied the heart now from Dublin to Paris
And if there was sunshine, it was never on me
So close the rain, so pronounced is the pain
Yeah

Well, I love you, imagine a world without you
It's only ever you, I only think of you
And if it's a blessing, I want it for you
If I must have a future, I want it with you
System in our hearts, you only had it before
You only opened the window, never opened up the door
And I love you, I love you, told you I do

Selling genocide and half-cut pride I understand
I had to be there from the start, I had to be the fucking man
It was a clamber of a life I sucked the ring off every hand
Had 'em plying me with drink, even met with their demands
When the cherries lined up I kept the spoilings for myself
Till I had 30 ways of dying looking at me from the shelf
A cloud-parting smile I had, a real good child I was
But this island's run by sharks with children's bones stuck in their jaws
Now the morning's filled with cokeys tryna talk you through it all
Is their mammy Fine Gael and is their daddy Fianna Fáil?
And they say they love the land but they don't feel it go to waste
Put a mirror to the youth and they will only see their face
Makes flowers read like broadsheets, ""every young man wants to die""
Say it to the man who profits and the bastard walks by
And the bastard walks by, and the passer walks by
Say it to him fifty times and still the bastard won't cry
Would I lie?

I love you, I love you, I told you I do
It's all I've ever felt, I've never felt so well
And if you don't know it, I wrote you this tune
To be here lovin' you when I'm in the tomb
System in our hearts, you only had it before
Echo, echo, echo, the lights they go
The lights they go, the lights they go
Echo, echo

Selling genocide and half-cut pride I understand
I had to be there from the start I had to be the fucking man
It was a clamber of a life, I sucked the ring off every hand
Had 'em plying me with drink, even met with their demands
And I loved ye like a penny loves the pocket of a priest
And I'll love you till the grass around my gravestone is deceased
And I'm heading for the cokeys, I will tell them 'bout it all
About the gall of Fine Gael and the fail of Fianna Fáil
And now the flowers read like broadsheets, every young man wants to die
Say it to the man who profits and the bastard walks by
And the bastard walks by, and the passer walks by
Say it to him fifty times and still the bastard won't cry

While always stays for none

Ooh La,The Kooks,"In their eyes is a place that you finally discovered
That you love it here, you've got to stay
On the bottom of the rock, an island
On which you find you love it when you twitch
You feel that itch in you pettycoat
Your pretty pretty pettycoat

Then you smiled, he got wild

I Want You,The Kooks,
If Only,The Kooks,"So hold your head, and hold your tongue
But only say what you have to
And as a child yes I dreamed
Of holding her in the silver screen
She loved her man and loved him twice
I wish I'd been that passenger
Having fun, fly my kite
The devil inside won't control my life
Too much love, so little hate
The devil inside won't control my fate

Oh, if only, if only
Oh, he wasn't so lonely
He'd have someone to play with
Instead of bombing our neighbours
Yeah, yeah...

So here I go to see the world
With my eyes and with my soul
And too much love, so little hate

Oh, if only, if only
Oh, he wasn't so lonely
He'd have someone to play with
Instead of bombing our neighbours

At flying piano's of all things, to set your scene

And it's true girl

You only go around, round, round
You only go around, round, round
You only go around, round, round

Speaks her mind not me, for I was only speaking freely
Interupt me once more, I'll take you to the cleaners

You only go around, round, round
You only go around, round, round

Whisper words in her ear,

Mr. Maker,The Kooks,"Mr. Maker he's got it made
A beautiful wife and a baby on the way
And his bills are already paid
No need to skimp, no need to save
But all around him, the world grows hard

If he was alone he'd give it all away
To people and things, that he wanted to save

But oh no, it's alright
Mr. Maker, he'll be fine
It's alright, it's OK
Because of the love he gave away
Oh yeah
Oh yeah...

Doesn't stop to think it's because of he
Always doing right, he stays healthy
The girls in the alley won't get a hold of him
He's got no time for that kind of sin
And he, he's not a member of the Catholic Church
The pastor of his town got sent down for dirt
He sees the boys from Sunday school
It's hard to believe what he read in the morning news

But oh no, it's alright
Mr. Maker, he'll be fine
It's all right, it's OK
Because of the love he gave away
Oh yeah
Oh yeah...

I worry for you
I worry for you
I worry for you

I'm just saying that I worry for
I'm just saying that I worry for
I'm just saying that I worry for
And I'm just saying that I worry for
I'm just saying that I worry for..."
Fa La La,The Kooks,"You're out there having fun, and I need you
I'm alone with this song about being empty and the fear of missing out
It's hard to be alone
Now eight miles I've walked up and down the hall
Long hall

Oh god, I miss my girl
It's only been a night
I miss the last time that we had a fight
Isn't it sad?
Won't you say it's bad?

I don't care and if I have to
I'll read your books because they'll remind me of you
And I'll learn your notes so that I have a clue
And I'll watch your films, so I'll know them through and through

And I'll do the things that remind me of you
And I'll wash my hair in your shampoo
And I'll buy your perfume and spray it 'round my room
And I'll smoke your cigarettes so that I'm dying too
And I call you up
Fa la la la
Fa la la la
Fa la la la

Oh, am I sane?
Am I sane?
Am I sane?"
Nothing Ever Changes,The Kooks,"I'd like to meet the girl I'm gonna marry
I'd like to meet the girl I'm going to see
Nothing ever changes in me
But you ain't got nothin', nothin' on me
The way everybody loves me I wish you could see
Nothin' ever changes in me

But I've go to be free
Oh, I've got to be free
Oh, I've got to be free

Like I said a long time ago things they come and things they go
Nothin' ever changes in me
You make me hungry then you make me see
Oh how happy my life can be
But nothin' ever change in me

I've got to be free
Oh, I've got to be free
I've got to be free
Oh, I've got to be free
I've got to be free
Oh, I've got to be free
Oh, I've got to be free
I've got to be free
Oh, I've got to be free"
By My Side,The Kooks,"When you feel like you've fallen out of use
Come by my side
The starved pain my girl you have induced
Come dine by my side

Everything she said to me was true
So now I know why
You look blue, it's eating through you
So come by my side

Don't want to fall out of love with you
Don't let me fall out of love with you

I'll dig down and I'll search for a heart of gold
In your diamond mind
Don't you know, my girl, I'd farm the world
To come dine by your side

Everything you say to me gets through
So now I know why
I'm not through with life because of you
So come by my side

Don't want to fall out of love with you
Don't let me fall out of love with you

Girl you know that I still need you
Pick it up and we'll find a way
Don't you know that I still need you
Look it up and we'll find a way

Don't wanna fall out of love with you
Don't let me fall out of love with you
Don't wanna fall out of love with you
Don't let me fall out of love with you"
Hatful Of Love,The Kooks,"I've got a hatful of love for you,
So why are you waiting so long,
Oh my love for you babe,
Is going so strong,

Oh honey please, don't shed no tears,
As long as I'm here,

I've got a hatful of love for you,
So why are you waiting so long,
Oh my love for you,
Well it is going so strong,

But oh honey please, don't shed no tears,
As long as I'm here,

Oh and I care for you,
So why are you waiting so long,
You carry on, I'll marry you,
But why is it taking so long?

But oh honey please, don't shed no tears,
As long as I'm here,
But oh honey please, don't shed no tears,
As long as I'm here."
Junk Of The Heart (Happy),The Kooks,"Junk of the heart is junk in my mind
So hard to leave you all alone
We get so drunk that we can hardly see
What use to that to you or me, baby?
See I notice nothing makes you shatter, no, no
You're a lover of the wild and a joker of the heart
But are you mine?

I wanna make you happy
I wanna make you feel alive
Let me make you happy
I wanna make you feel alive at night
I wanna make you happy
If you're a good girl tonight

We sink to be sunk, but life is no race
When I'm not happy I'm in disgrace
So I spend time with guessing on you
You're a lover of the wild and a joker of the heart
But are you mine?

I wanna make you happy
I wanna make you feel alive
Let me make you happy
I wanna make you feel alive at night
I wanna make you happy
If you're a good girl tonight

Still I notice nothing makes you shatter no, no
You're a lover of the wild and a joker of the heart
But are you mine?

I wanna make you happy
I wanna make you feel alive
Let me make you happy
I wanna make you feel alive at night
I wanna make you happy
If you're a good girl tonight"
How'd You Like That,The Kooks,"Well, I was sleeping
Only in my head
Slipping in and out of time

And I was lifting
Always higher
And the women of heaven sang

They were singing
How'd you like that?
How'd you like that?
How'd you like that?

How'd you like that?
How'd you like that?
How'd you like that?
I like it

How'd you like that?
How'd you like that?
How'd you like that?
It lifts me up

What better time to
Take a ride with you
Through the universe tonight

The look of silence
Much like your face
And the symphony that helps me sing

They were singing,
How'd you like that?
How'd you like that?
How'd you like that?

How'd you like that?
How'd you like that?
How'd you like that?
I liked it

How'd you like that?
How'd you like that?
How'd you like that?
I only just let go

How'd you like that?
How'd you like that?
How'd you like that?

How'd you like that?
How'd you like that?
How'd you like that?
I like it

How'd you like that?

How'd you like that?
How'd you like that?

I feel for what you feel for me
Let's work together
(How'd you like that?
How'd you like that?
How'd you like that?)
Take it out across the sea
To America
(How'd you like that?
How'd you like that?
How'd you like that?)

I feel for you what you feel for me,
so let's work together
(How'd you like that?
How'd you like that?
How'd you like that?)
Take it out across the sea
Let's work together"
Rosie,The Kooks,"See the same old crowd again
Wash my hands and shake my feet
And yes I missed you all
Since I last saw you I fell down the rabbit hole

As I wonder what we'd be like
Wrapped up, so up tight with you
Lust will do funny things
I don't want you to go out looking so good
And you look so good

Rosie,
Well I feel your love and I want you to agree
To be,
Still take your time but get to me
Rosie

She looked away as I mentioned my name
The street lights light up my shame
The world can take you and swallow you whole
But you're a big girl and I think you already know
You've been bought and sold

Be careful with me
I see all that you see
Troy died in a day for little Rosie

Rosie,
Well I feel your love and I want you to agree
To be,
Still take your time roll your stone to me
Rosie

Gonna find you now I'll walk the beat
And you'll do me a pirouette in the street
And although we'll fall we'll find our feet
Rosie

Well I wanted you so easily
Illusions past and now I see
Image is so different to reality
Rosie"
Taking Pictures Of You,The Kooks,"I have a secret I want to tell you
Each time that I close my eyes
I can feel you
I run away with my imagination
And I am blinded by your light
You fill up the room
Ooh whoa oh

I have a secret I need to tell you
Exquisite visions fill up my mind
Do you remember me?
Taking pictures of you as the light came through
You were running away
And I asked you for a place to stay
Do you remember me, taking pictures of you
Taking pictures of you

Now, I have a secret I need to tell you
I have been true, and I needed no clue
We live in such extraordinary times
Exquisite visions fill up my mind

Do you remember me?
Taking pictures of you as the light came through
You were running away
And you asked me for a place to stay
Do you remember me?
Taking pictures of you
Such a wonderful thing to do"
F**k The World Off,The Kooks,"Yeah,
All I wanna do is get to you,
Get to you, get to you,
So let me fuck the world off just for you,
Let me do that for you,

What me tow the line,
Back home, get back home, just for you,
I think I heard someone on London streets,
People to meet, people like you,

And there will be waterfalls,
For you to break through,
If you so choose,
I know you think too much to lose,
So let me fuck the world off just for you,
Let me do that for you,
I know that I could make you so pleased,
Pleased to be, to be with me,

I feel like I'm on the end of the line,
End of the line just to get,
Someone one London streets to tell,
You my thoughts, just to you,

And there will be waterfalls,
For you to break through,
If you so choose,
I know you think too much to lose,

So let me fuck the world off just for you,
Let me do that for you"
Time Above The Earth,The Kooks,"I've spent so much time above the earth
I'm thinking about life and each man's worth
How could one person be worth more than
A thousand people knocking on his door

Still the motion of your hair
Well that could take me anywhere
Because you're happier than I
Please don't say goodbye

Then I get off the plane
A thousand thoughts reaching through my brain
Like am I really here at all

Will I see her again
If I do will it feel the same
And am I really here at all"
Is It Me,The Kooks,"Is it me, is it you
Is it the times that we're living through
Was it hard when I had to leave
That day you seemed to change
We all need someone to guide us
Someone to introduce the show
I needed someone just like you
Someone to let me know
I could lose it all

Well I began to breakdown
Searching overtime
Bring me a pig's heart
And a glass of wine
There was nothing that you could've done
There was nothing that you should've said
We're both still chasing shadows in our heads
It was all too soon

But is it me, is it you
Is it the times that we're going through
Was it hard, did your heart breakdown
Is your mind still in control
There is a violence in love
Some things I'll never understand
So where the bullets missed you out
They hit me and I'm falling down again

Well I began to breakdown
Searching overtime
Bring me a pig's heart
And a glass of wine
There was nothing that you could've done
There was nothing that you should've said
I'm still chasing shadows in my head
It was all too soon

Was it me, was it you
Was it the times that we're living through
On my way to see you again
You were my only friend
I know you needed someone to guide you
And the world you should've owned
I needed someone to guide me
Someone to let me know
I could lose it all"
Killing Me,The Kooks,"It's killing me
Yeah, the things that you can do
That no one else can do to me at all

Am I wasting my time?
As I feel that I'll go out
And find someone that's out of luck too

And if I had to do it all again
I were to feel the love that I know you can send
Did I send love?
Did I move too close?
Will the wind blow her away?
Will the wind blow her away?

And I saw you cry
So I know you didn't mean
To creep into my dreams just to turn me down

You say you feel so used
But it was you who turned it on
And used all of your charms just to bring me in

And everybody knows the games she plays
And every time she loses she runs away
Did I send love?
Did I move too close?
Will the wind blow her away?
Where will the wind blow her today?
Will the wind blow her away?

You can help me out
I want to love you again
You can help me out
I want to love you again
'cause I feel so cold without sun
And you're the one I can't run from

Will the wind blow her away?
Will the wind blow her away?
Will the wind blow her away?"
Petulia,The Kooks,"Say it's just right when you're around
Take a drive, take a drive to town
Meaningful, nothing but you
Petulia, you're in my blood again

Like a heart undone
Like a love without a sound
Like a heartbeat
Moving through me

Say it's just right
Life on my brown
Take it low
Take a drive to town
Meaningless, everything but you

Petulia, let's make a wish
For a heart undone
A love without a sound
Like a heartbeat
Moving through me

Like a heart undone
Like a love without a sound
Like a heartbeat
Moving through me"
Eskimo Kiss,The Kooks,"We had so much fun
She gave me an eskimo kiss
We put our records on
And set sail towards the sun,
Oh it's so much fun

She's like the rose without a thorn,
She's like the sunflower that never looks back at the sun
She sees me running
She's like a diamond in the rough
She's like the first girl on this earth that you wanted to touch,
She sees me running

We went back to her place
Her father says I have the wrong face
He put another one on
We set sail, as the night gets long,
Oh, it's so much fun!

She's like the rose without a thorn,
She's like the sunflower that never looks back at the sun
She sees me running
She's like the diamond in the rough
She's like the first girl on this earth that you wanted to touch,
She sees me running, sees me running

Oh, lonely bones
Well, I'm coming through the sun
And our lives have just begun
Oh, lonely bones
Yeah, I'm coming through the sun
And our lives have just begun

And it goes...
La la la la la
La la la la la
La la la la la

And it goes...
La la la la la
Did you ever wonder why
This old word will make you cry?
And it goes
La la la la la
Did you ever wonder why
This old word will make you cry?"
Mr. Nice Guy,The Kooks,"No more Mr. Nice Guy
I'm wishing you be leaving
You think that everybody wants you
Your nose is itching and you're so slow
To tell me everything about you
Yeah, but I already know you

Don't believe in things that don't believe in you
Believe in you
Oh the things that you do will come back on you
See them true

You want to spend some time together
Suspended like a feather
But you're acting like a nico
Playing with your ego
Always trying with the right crowd
Never alone turn it up loud

Don't believe in things that don't believe in you
Believe in you
Oh the things that you do will come back on you
So see them true

No more Mr. Nice Guy

Don't believe in things that don't believe in you
Believe in you
Every things that you do will come back on you
So see them true

No more Mr. Nice Guy"
Around Town,The Kooks,"You can get yourself into a fight
If that's the way you wanna live your life
You can get yourself connected
To the world that we are thrown to, yeah

But all I need is somewhere to lay
Somewhere to lay my hat up
I need someone to love in the middle of the day
I want someone to be, and someone to drive around town
I need someone to love when the chips are down
Love me when the chips are down
Will you love me when the chips are down?
Love me when the chips are down
Could you love me when the world is crashing all around?

You can try and be someone you're not
If that's the river that you want to cross
You can choose the life of a bohemian
Or you can choose the material world

But all I need is somewhere to lay
Somewhere to lay my hat up
I need someone to love in the middle of the day
I need someone to be, someone to drive around town
I need someone to love when the chips are down
Oh yeah
Love me when the chips are down, oh
Love me when the chips are down
Love me when the chips are down
Could you love me when the world is crashing all around?
All around

All I need is somewhere to lay
Somewhere to lay my hat up
I need someone to love in the middle of the day
I want someone to be, and someone to drive around town
I need someone to love, one to love, one to love
Love me when the chips are down
Yeah
Will you love me when the chips are down
Oh oh
Love me when the chips are down
Love me when the chips are down
Could you love me when the world is crashing all around?"
Forgive & Forget,The Kooks,"[Intro:]
Don't say that I never moved you
Just because I saw the light before you did
Yes, I know that I never showed you
All the rooms inside of my soul

Yeah Yeah
You say you need someone to love you
But it ain't me

Walking up and down the hall
Frankie and his third lover
Speaking all the words she wants to hear
But that don't mean forever

Yeah
You say you need someone to love you
But it ain't me

Yeah
You say you need someone to love you
But it ain't me

Sitting down by the fire
Frankie plays the guitar
People playing make believe
They say, ""can we get a little higher?""

You give it away
You give it away
You give it away
You give it away
So easy baby

But I can't stand
An hour break
Another day
So let me make it easy babe

And it goes on and on

Packing her bags
She found somewhere to stay
And in the car to the station
You know the world looks a little brighter
And then there's no need for conversations
Tell me why

You give it away
You give it away
You give it away
You give it away
So easy baby

But I can't stand
An hour break
Another day
So let me make it easy babe

And it goes on

Westside,The Kooks,"I was living on the Westside
When you brought me South
At first you didn't like the look of me
Your borders were closed
Although you said I'm bad company
We stayed in touch
You made it hard work for me
Working for your love
But now

Well we can settle down
We'll start a family
Cos' you're my best friend
And you're so good to me
Well we can settle down
We'll start a family
Cos' you're my best friend

See Me Now,The Kooks,"Well I've been a lot places,
I learned to tie my own tie too,
I've met a lot of faces,
I've got some questions I'd like to ask you.

If you could see me now,
If you could see my smile,
See your little boy,
Oh, would you be proud?

I've been in sticky situations,
I fell in love with a girl who likes girls,
I know mom's thinking of you,
I'm busy trying to make it in this world,
I hope I'm living your dream, daddy
Have a drink on me upstairs

If you could see me now,
If you could see my smile,
See your little boy,
Oh, would you be proud?
[x4]

Well I've been a lot places,
I learned to tie my own tie too."
It Was London,The Kooks,"It was in London,
Where we heard the revolution,
From Covent Garden,
All the way down to Brixton.

It was in Tottenham,
Man got shot by a policeman,
A young girl went to test them,
Went up against the system,
Oh oh, I don't know

Who are you
Who are you

On the television,
Of course they blame the youth for disruption,
Cause they took Fortnum & Mason,
And nothing said about the shooting,
Just the looting

It was in London
It was in London

And it was thunder,
Caught between love and anger,
From Trafalgar,
All the way up to Camden

Can you believe this is London?
Can you believe this is London?
Can you believe this is London?
Can you believe this is London?
Can you believe this is London?
Can you believe this is London?
Can you believe this is London?

London town, London town
London town, London town"

Dreams,The Kooks,"Baby in the morning, pour me your dreams,
Don't bring me coffee, I'm somewhere in between.
Baby in the morning, sing me your dreams,
I was saudi drifting and a lion followed me.
The colours I'd not seen before, they were invented in my head,
Or was it that I left this world to the land of the undead?

Where were you last night, (she said) I was playing the flute,
In front of the Eiffel tower to a man in a starlight suit.
Then it was when you came in I recognized your eyes,
You were with the lion and you started to cry.

It'll be okay, be okay, be okay, be okay, be okay, be okay.
Everybody's gone, there's nothing left.

Baby in the morning, pour me your dreams,
Don't bring me coffee, I'm somewhere in between.
Baby in the morning, don't wake me too soon,
I'm lying in satin in the middle of the moon.
Coming down the mountain, I'm not one I'm two
Holy angel, cradle me to the land of the undead.

When everybody's gone, there's nothing left.
When everybody's gone, there's nothing left."
Are We Electric,The Kooks,"When will we believe it, when will we see the light?
Stop running from it; why do we keep denying?
That we can feel it, when we've got each other
And we are electric together

Are we really moving, are we really here?
Are we just electric or something engineered?
Always there to haunt me, lions in the sand
About to cross back over, then you grab my hand

Are we a simulation, do we really feel?
Flesh can be deceiving; are we caught inside a wheel?
Are you disconnected, do you need somewhere to land?
This is evolution, so please just take my hand

Electric together

When will we believe it, when will we see the light?
Stop running from it; why do we keep denying?
That we can feel it, when we've got each other
And we are electric together
Electric together
Electric together
Electric together
Electric together

Have we hit the ceiling, are we both the same?
Are we still electric, have we come undone again?
Are you searching for the answers, are you looking for the plans?
Why don't we just surrender, please just take my hand

Electric together

When will we believe it, when will we see the light?
Stop running from it; why do we keep denying?
That we can feel it, when we've got each other
And we are electric together
Electric together
Electric together
Electric together
Electric together

Electric together
Electric together
Please just take my hand

When will we believe it, when will we see the light?
Stop running from it; why do we keep denying?
That we can feel it, when we've got each other
And we are electric together

When will we believe it, when will we see the light?
Stop running from it; why do we keep denying?
That we can feel it, when we've got each other

Sunrise,The Kooks,"I want you, to show me the way to your heart
I need to, so show me the way to your heart

Kids,The Kooks,"Sitting in my room painting the world
And the kids are not alright
Good England thrown to the wolves
And the lunatics taking over
Heaven I found under my demons
And the smoking gun
That you found
Lying on the ground

I'm just sitting painting the world
And the kids are not alright

When I don't have a choice
That's when I find my voice
I'm not trying to be
What you want me to be
I'm not your friend I'm your queen
You're quickly losing your scene
I'm not trying to be what you want me to be

Woah woah woah
Woah woah woah
Woah woah woah
Woah woah woah
The kids are not alright

Standing up in front of a mountain
And I don't want to fight
The clouds answer to no one
They don't need the sun
The streets are dark and the gas light leads me
Soon I'm out of sight
Howling back
Back at the moon

I'm just sitting painting the world
And the kids are not alright

When I don't have a choice
That's when I find my voice
I'm not trying to be
What you want me to be
I'm not your friend I'm your queen
You're quickly losing your scene
I'm not trying to be what you want me to be

Woah woah woah
Woah woah woah

All the Time,The Kooks,"Why don't you stay here? I wanna spend some time
Why don't you lay here? Make the full moon cry
Why don't you love me the way I want you to?
You cut up the best dress I ever bought for you

But you don't have to doubt or figure me out
Let me show you the way it's gonna be
You don't have to doubt what it's all about
See the light that leads you here, we can find a way

I want you to be there all the time
I want you to be there when I die
I want you, you, just don't ask why
I want you, you, all the time
I want you

Your scent brings me flowers, your heart, it brings me wine
All of these hours, I wanna do that time
Your love is such hardship, but work I'm pleased to do
And my back is breaking, fire I'll walk through

You don't have to doubt or figure it out
See the light that leads you here, we can find a way

I want you to be there all the time
I want you to be there when I die
I want you, you, just don't ask why
I want you, you, all the time
I want you

We don't need the seas to separate
No regret
See the storm in you against your own
Cigarette

And you don't have to doubt what it's all about
Darkness coming down, night is all around

I want you to be there all the time
I want you to be there when I die
I want you, you, just don't ask why
I want you, you, all the time
I want you to be there all the time
I want you to be there when I die
I want you, you, just don't ask why
I want you, you, all the time

I got a window I'm trying to live inside
I got a lover and she's kind of kind
She got a feeling like I'm somebody else
I'm gonna run with that

Fractured and Dazed,The Kooks,"I'll never give your love
I'll never give your love away
Remember love
When we weren't so fractured and dazed

In a world
Where we try to hurt each other
I know you feel bad
For what you did and how you recovered

I'm a blessed man
Just to have touched your face
But then again
Who are you to make me replace that

And if I was you
I would have done the same
When lies meant truth to you
It was you who loved the fame

I'll never give your love
I'll never give your love away
Woah woah
I'll never give you up
No matter what you say
Woah woah

Blue eyes
And a flicker of wonder in you
Shadows of youth
Never a greater sorrow

Five hundred years in the wild with you
Wouldn't be enough
We flying
Too crazy to imitate

And if I was you
I would have done the same
When lies meant truth to you
It was you who loved the fame

I'll never give your love
I'll never give your love away
Woah woah
Remember love, remember love
When we weren't so fractured and dazed

I'll never give your love
I'll never give your love away
I'll never give you up
No matter what you say
Woah woah

Never give you up
Never give, never give you up
So fractured and dazed

No no
So so fractured and dazed
Remember love

You're so fractured and dazed

And if I was you
I would have done the same"
Chicken Bone,The Kooks,"Hard times in the city
I get over, I get under
Don't it make you feel dizzy?
All the anger
I don't mean to be jealous
But my eyes have seen you with fellas
I find it hard to be part of the city when it's so unjust
It makes me feel like I wanna die, that's why

I don't drink alone
(I never drink alone)
I got a big fine mamma at home
(I just can't get enough)
She calls me chicken bone
(My midnight tone)
And then she rolls me like a stone
(I just can't get enough)

Bricked up in the city
And the buildings are laughing
Pay check burning my pocket
Going to buy a gold chain and a locket
Makes me feel like I'm gonna lie, that's why

I don't drink alone
(I never drink alone)
I got a big fine mamma at home
(I just can't get enough)
She calls me chicken bone
(My midnight tone)
And then she rolls me like a stone
(I just can't get enough)

She sings when it's over
When it's over she sings
She doesn't worry as I walk out the door
'Cos tomorrow I'll bring
Two small chocolates and a bottle of wine
A very nice time

All my pennies, my farthings
For my mortgage that I'm under
At her place all the sorrows
Of the world can wait 'til tomorrow
She makes me feel like it's all alright, that's why

I don't drink alone
(I never drink alone)
I got a big fine mamma at home
(I just can't get enough)
She calls me chicken bone
(My midnight tone)
And then she rolls me like a stone

You got me tied down my honey bee
And yes I love to love you the way that I do
You were always on my mind
So I say it one more time

Friends and power were all I craved
One look at you and I was changed girl

Pamela,The Kooks,"Oh Pamela what did you do
You touched the ground and I fell in love with you
Oh Pamela what did they say
I reached for your hand but you turned and walked away

And can you lend your ears about my mate Pamela
So naughty but she loves her fella
One wink and a glint in the other one
At night she only wears Yves Saint Laurent
Watches black and white movies to get thin
Curls her hair just like Marilyn
Oh what an enigmatic woman
My gosh do some mothers have 'em

Oh Pamela what did you do
You touched the ground and I fell in love with you
Oh Pamela what did they say
I reached for your hand but you turned and walked away

Can you lend you ears for a man in trouble
She tripped me up and now I see double
I asked her what her life was missing
And if she'd like to go trout mask kissing
She said go get high with the other ones
I looked around lights on but no one home
Oh what an enigmatic woman
My gosh do some mothers have them

Earl grey and lemons in the morning
By noon her nurse comes calling
Limousine with a stretcher in the back
They strap her down when she has a panic attack
I followed her down to the hospital
No visitors allowed on a bicycle
So I threw rocks up to the window
I broke the glass so she could feel the wind blow

Oh Pamela what did you do
You touched the ground and I fell in love with you
Oh Pamela what did they say

Picture Frame,The Kooks,"I didn't notice anything strange
About the picture in your picture frame
It was drawn of a fountain in your Paris
Bought for a fiver most probably
Didn't mean a lot to me, a lot to me

You tell me that you'd never sell this
That the artist himself was beneath this
That life itself was within this
And I look to the sky to worship the ground

And you never asked for nothing at all
Even as the wolves clawed at your door
And you do your best to fold me
And unfold me again

Time will make fools of us all
It's time to find meaning or control
Every time we go out now you pretend
Pretend we're not lovers just friends
And it gets to me, gets to me

You tell me the meaning of life is
To be happy and to give up loss
But you never lost something you loved
But I turn around, how could I be angry at you?

When you never asked for nothing at all
Even as the wolves clawed at your door
And you do your best to fold me
And unfold me again
Never fold me again

And it gets to me, gets to me

Tell me the meaning of life is
To be happy and to give up loss
You never lost something you loved
And I turn around, how could I be angry at you?

But you asked me to come in from the cold
And to warm your bed as you fold me
And unfold me again
And you never asked for nothing at all"

And I don't care where I came from
A lucky nail with my name on
I coulda been something special, something brighter
At least I know, I know I'm a fighter

And city boys always wondering why
Two lovers on the outside
If you got love you don't have to hide

Sailing on a Dream,The Kooks,"You don't understand my point of view
That's okay, you've got your version of the truth
Obsessed with humble poets and pointed shoes
Crying out your tears into tangerines
Climbing down your necklace to your lips
Try to understand

I'm sailing on a dream
Bursting at the seams
And you don't have to hide away
Come out and see the day
I'm sailing on a dream

In my dreams I'm flying through Arabian skies
Crossing purple rivers to hidden goldmines
Try to undertsand

I'm sailing on a dream
Bursting at the seams
And you don't have to hide away
Come out and see the day
I'm sailing on a dream

Dream
Dream, dream, dream...

Sailing
Let me go

And you don't have to hide away
Come out and see the day

From the life I had I shouldn't hesitate
Walk like an animal into the world of glass
Seems so fragile yeah, nothing was built to last

All the lovers you had
All the lives that you led mean nothing
It's trickling down
And I can't hear a sound they make
In the modern days

We live for these modern days
Oh babe we live for these modern days
In the modern days
We live for these modern days
Oh babe we live for these modern days

(We live for these modern days
Oh babe we live for these modern days)

This is bigger than the fear of atom bombs
The truth is on sale at your local restaurant
The time for selling out has been and gone and died
Music lover in a whirlwind, not your time

Afraid of the shadows I send
I know I got to get up to the ceiling again

Put me out of my misery now
I won't slip away

But I know what I want you to say
And the atoms in my heart all pray together
I'll hold you forever

Oasis,The Kooks,"You make me see things I never thought were possible
I feel free, I feel so irresponsible
Dancing in the mirror, look at what a state I'm in
How can I be the one to take you home

Because you make this place feel like an oasis
Yeah, you put the smile on all of these faces

Sitting in a daze, I never felt comfortable
I'm insecure, but you make it achievable
Close the door, walking up the walls
Fall into my eyes
Only you can get me through the night

Because you make this place feel like an oasis

25,The Kooks,"A fetish rosey cheeked is left alone
There is no justice
Yeah we know this from when we're young
The smoke dances in the mirror out of the gun
And she lost her sadness
In the madness she has to run

Oh it hurts to say goodbye
Just when I learned not to make you cry
Life passes by in the blink of an eye
You know to me, girl, we'll always be 25
These tears will dry
These tears will dry
But it still hurts to say goodbye

She doesn't notice
As the disguises enter the room
The look of the the flower
The casual killer lights up the gloom

Oh it hurts to say goodbye
Just when I learned not to make you cry
Life passes by in the blink of an eye
You know to me, girl, we'll always be 25
These tears will dry
These tears will dry
But it still hurts to say goodbye

I just need more
I just need more, I just need more time

If you don't speak the language, it's impossible to read
Our destiny is waiting and our fate is on the phone
Saying, ""Don't forget your papers for the satisfaction zone""

Can't find the truth if you don't know where it grows
It's as rare as real pleasure, in celebrities it shows
There are things I never told you 'cause I haven't got the guts

I drink to drown my sorrows but they always learn to swim
Thank you very much, yes, I am a little thin
When I exorcise my demons I just take 'em to the gym
But I hope it doesn't matter

Seven years sober, couldn't give you up for Lent
So I never even questioned if your cookies had consent
I acted on an urge, now I sit here and lament
But I hoped it wouldn't matter

I should've known
You are not alone
You're not alone
You're not alone

Or just a little foolish
I do myself a disservice

Well, something to believe in
Like my own religion

You leaving, you leaving

The meat in your sandwich

And if I had five minutes on earth with you left
I would keep playing dead until you were impressed
So that I'd not make promises I couldn't keep anymore

I've been working on my mind's interior design
Tryna give this place a little light
Sometimes it feels like I just can't get anything right
But I'd sit in a windowless room every day
Tryna see everything through
If I thought it would give me a panoramic view of you

When digital gangsters were stealing your innocence
I put an order in just to show insolence
Then they got caught and I felt like a failure
So loved you so loud, they could hear in Australia
And then I had five minutes on earth with you left
But I kept playing dead until you were impressed
So that I'd not make promises I couldn't keep anymore

I've been working on my mind's interior design
Tryna give this place a little light
Sometimes it feels like I just can't get anything right
But I'd sit in a windowless room every day
Tryna see everything through
If I thought it would give me a panoramic view of you

Every inch of you built like the Mecca
Bacon, secret sauce, cheese, double-decker
You're the best thing they've got on the menu
Want you while you're still warm
Want you so much that it's become the norm

I've been working on my mind's interior design
Tryna give this place a little light
Sometimes it feels like I just can't get anything right
But I'd sit in a windowless room every day
Tryna see everything through
If I thought it would give me a panoramic view of you

Remember that night taking Mexican ecstasy?
Codeine, corrido and crashing out next to me
Can't call a cab and I can't read your reply
The Tower of London cut off my free Wi-Fi
So now we've got five minutes on earth with them left
Let's just keep playing dead until they are impressed
So that we won't make promises we cannot keep anymore"
Do I Wanna Know?,Arctic Monkeys,"Have you got colour in your cheeks?
Do you ever get that fear that you can't shift
The type that sticks around like summat in your teeth?
Are there some aces up your sleeve?
Have you no idea that you're in deep?
I dreamt about you nearly every night this week
How many secrets can you keep?
'Cause there's this tune I found that makes me think of you somehow and I play it on repeat
Until I fall asleep
Spilling drinks on my settee

(Do I wanna know?)
If this feeling flows both ways?
(Sad to see you go)
Was sort of hoping that you'd stay
(Baby, we both know)
That the nights were mainly made for saying things that you can't say tomorrow day

Crawling back to you

Ever thought of calling when you've had a few?
'Cause I always do
Maybe I'm too busy being yours to fall for somebody new
Now I've thought it through

Crawling back to you

So have you got the guts?
Been wondering if your heart's still open and if so I wanna know what time it shuts
Simmer down and pucker up
I'm sorry to interrupt. It's just I'm constantly on the cusp of trying to kiss you
I don't know if you feel the same as I do
But we could be together if you wanted to

(Do I wanna know?)
If this feeling flows both ways?
(Sad to see you go)
Was sort of hoping that you'd stay
(Baby, we both know)
That the nights were mainly made for saying things that you can't say tomorrow day

R U Mine?,Arctic Monkeys,"I'm a puppet on a string
Tracy Island,
Time-traveling diamond
Cutter shaped heartaches
Come to find you
Four in some velvet morning
Years too late
She's a silver lining
Lone ranger riding
Through an open space
In my mind when she's not right there beside me

I go crazy 'cause here isn't where I wanna be
And satisfaction feels like a distant memory
And I can't help myself,
All I wanna hear her say is ""Are you mine?""

Well, are you mine?
Are you mine?
Are you mine?

I guess what I'm trying to say
Is I need the deep end
Keep imagining meeting,
Wished away entire lifetimes
Unfair we're not somewhere
Misbehaving for days
Great escape
Lost track of time and space
She's a silver lining climbing on my desire

And I go crazy 'cause here isn't where I wanna be
And satisfaction feels like a distant memory
And I can't help myself,
All I wanna hear her say is ""Are you mine?""

Well, are you mine? (are you mine tomorrow?)
Are you mine? (or just mine tonight?)
Are you mine? (are you mine? Mine?)

And the thrill of the chase
Moves in mysterious ways
So in case I'm mistaken,
I just wanna hear you say
""You got me, baby. Are you mine?""

She's a silver lining
Lone ranger riding
Through an open space
In my mind when she's not right there beside me

I go crazy 'cause here isn't where I wanna be

And I can't help myself,
All I wanna hear her say is ""Are you mine?""

One For The Road,Arctic Monkeys,"One for the road, ooh ooh
One for the road, ooh ooh

From the bottom of your heart
The relegation zone
I saw this coming from the start
The shake, rattle and roll
The cracks in blackout blinds
Cast patterns on the ceiling but you're feeling fine
I thought it was dark outside
I thought it was dark outside

One for the road

So we all go back to yours and you sit and talk to me on the floor
There's no need to show me 'round baby, I feel like I've been here before
I've been wondering whether later when you tell everybody to go,
Will you pour me one for the road?

I knew this would be on the cards
I knew you wouldn't fold
I saw this coming from the start
The shake, rattle and roll

One for the road, ooh ooh

So we all go back to yours and you sit and talk to me on the floor
There's no need to show me 'round baby, I feel like I've been here before
I've been wondering whether later when you tell everybody to go,
Will you pour me one for the road?

The mixture hits you hard
Don't get that sinking feeling, don't fall apart
Some out of tune guitar
Soundtrack to disaster

Ooh ooh, one for the road
Ooh ooh, one for the road
Ooh ooh, one for the road
Ooh ooh, one for the road

So we all go back to yours and you sit and talk to me on the floor
There's no need to show me 'round baby, I feel like I've been here before

Will you pour me one for the road?"
Arabella,Arctic Monkeys,"Arabella's got some interstellar gator skin boots
And a Helter Skelter 'round her little finger and I ride it endlessly
She's got a Barbarella silver swimsuit
And when she needs to shelter from reality she takes a dip in my daydreams

My days end best when the sunset gets itself behind
That little lady sitting on the passenger side
It's much less picturesque without her catching the light
The horizon tries but it's just not as kind on the eyes

As Arabella, oh
As Arabella
Just might have tapped into your mind and soul
You can't be sure

Arabella's got a '70s head
But she's a modern lover
It's an exploration, she's made of outer space
And her lips are like the galaxy's edge
And her kiss the colour of a constellation falling into place

My days end best when the sunset gets itself behind
That little lady sitting on the passenger side
It's much less picturesque without her catching the light
The horizon tries but it's just not as kind on the eyes

As Arabella, oh
As Arabella
Just might have tapped into your mind and soul
You can't be sure

That's magic in a cheetah print coat
Just a slip underneath it I hope
Asking if I can have one of those
Organic cigarettes that she smokes
Wraps her lips 'round the Mexican Coke
Makes you wish that you were the bottle
Takes a sip of your soul and it sounds like...

Just might have tapped into your mind and soul
You can't be sure"
I Want It All,Arctic Monkeys,"Blind faith

My sweet rigmarole
I want it all

Old dogs
New tricks
Can you feel it?
Space age country girl
Stone cold miracle
I want it all
I want it all

And then suddenly it hit me it's a year ago
Since I drank miniature whiskey and we shared your coke
Ain't it just like you to kiss me and then hit the road
Leave me listening to the stones
2000 light years from home

Shoo wop shoo wop shoo wop shoo wah

No. 1 Party Anthem,Arctic Monkeys,"So you're on the prowl wondering whether she left already or not
Leather jacket, collar popped like antenna
Never knowing when to stop
Sunglasses indoors, par for the course
Lights in the floors and sweat on the walls
Cages and poles

Call off the search for your soul, or put it on hold again
She's having a sly indoor smoke
She calls the folks who run this her oldest friends
Sipping her drink and laughing at imaginary jokes
As all the signals are sent, her eyes invite you to approach
And it seems as though those lumps in your throat
That you just swallowed have got you going

Come on, come on, come on
Come on, come on, come on
Number one party anthem

She's a certified mind blower, knowing full well that I don't
May suggest there's somewhere from which you might know her
Just to get the ball to roll
Drunken monologues, confused because
It's not like I'm falling in love I just want you to do me no good
And you look like you could

Come on, come on, come on
Come on, come on, come on
Number one party anthem
Come on, come on, come on
Before the moment's gone
Number one party anthem
Yeah, yeah

The look of love - the rush of blood
The ""She's with me"" 's - the Gallic shrug
The shutterbugs - the Camera Plus
The black and white - the colour dodge
The good time girls - the cubicles
The house of fun - the number one party anthem

Come on, come on, come on
Come on, come on, come on
Come on, come on, come on
Come on, come on, come on
Before the moment's gone

Mad Sounds,Arctic Monkeys,"Mad sounds in your ears make you feel alright
They bring you back to life
Mad sounds in your ears, they make you get up and dance
They make you get up

Yeah, they make you get up

Love buckles under the strain of those wild nights
Run but you cannot hide

Mad sounds in your ears make you get up and dance
Make you get up
All night long reappear
Make you get up and dance

Yeah, they make you get up

Suppose you've gotta do what you gotta do
We just weren't feeling how we wanted to
You sit and try sometimes but you just can't figure out what went wrong
Then out of nowhere somebody comes and hits you with an
Ooh la la la la...

Fireside,Arctic Monkeys,"I can't explain but I want to try
There's this image of you and I
And it goes dancing by in the morning and in the night time

There's all these secrets that I can't keep
Like in my heart there's that hotel suite and you lived there so long,
It's kinda strange now you're gone

I'm not sure if I should show you what I've found
Has it gone for good?
Or is it coming back around?
Isn't it hard to make up your mind?
When you're losing and your fuse is fireside

There's all those places we used to go
And I suspect you already know
But that place on memory lane you liked still looks the same
But something about it's changed

I'm not sure if I should show you what I've found
Has it gone for good?
Or is it coming back around?
Isn't it hard to make up your mind?
When you're losing and your fuse is fireside

And I thought I was yours forever
Maybe I was mistaken but I just cannot manage to make it through the day
Without thinking of you lately

I'm not sure if I should show you what I've found
Has it gone for good?
Or is it coming back around?
Isn't it hard to make up your mind?

Why'd You Only Call Me When You're High?,Arctic Monkeys,"The mirror's image
Tells me it's home time
But I'm not finished
'Cause you're not by my side
And as I arrived I thought I saw you leaving
Carrying your shoes
Decided that once again I was just dreaming
Of bumping into you

Now it's three in the morning and I'm trying to change your mind
Left you multiple missed calls and to my message you reply
""Why'd you only call me when you're high?
Hi, why'd you only call me when you're high?""

Somewhere darker
Talking the same shite
I need a partner (hey)
Well, are you out tonight?
It's harder and harder to get you to listen
More I get through the gears
Incapable of making alright decisions
And having bad ideas

Now it's three in the morning and I'm trying to change your mind
Left you multiple missed calls and to my message you reply (message you reply)
""Why'd you only call me when you're high? (why'd you only call me when you're high?)
Hi, why'd you only call me when you're high?""

And I can't see you here wonder where I might?
Sort of feels like I'm running out of time
I haven't found what I was hoping to find
You said, ""You gotta be up in the morning, gonna have an early night
And you're starting to bore me, baby
Why'd you only call me when you're high?""

Why'd you only ever phone me when you're high?
Why'd you only ever phone me when you're high?
Why'd you only ever phone me when you're high?
Why'd you only ever phone me when you're high?"
Snap Out Of It,Arctic Monkeys,"What's been happening in your world?
What have you been up to?

I wanna grab both your shoulders and shake baby
Snap out of it (Snap out of it)
I get the feeling I left it too late, but baby
Snap out of it (Snap out of it)
If that watch don't continue to swing or the fat lady fancies having a sing
I'll be here waiting ever so patiently for you to
Snap out of it

Forever isn't for everyone
Is forever for you?
It sounds like settling down or giving up
But it don't sound much like you girl

I wanna grab both your shoulders and shake baby

I get the feeling I left it too late, but baby
Snap out of it (Snap out of it)

Knee Socks,Arctic Monkeys,"You got the lights on in the afternoon
And the nights are drawn out long
And you're kissing to cut through the gloom
With a cough-drop-coloured tongue
And you were sitting in the corner with the coats all piled high
And I thought you might be mine
In a small world on an exceptionally rainy Tuesday night
In the right place and time

When the zeros line up on the 24 hour clock
When you know who's calling even though the number is blocked
When you walked around your house wearing my sky blue Lacoste
And your knee socks

Well you cured my January blues
Yeah you made it all alright
I got a feeling I might have lit the very fuse
That you were trying not to light
You were a stranger in my phone book I was acting like I knew
'Cause I had nothing to lose
When the winter's in full swing and your dreams just aren't coming true
Ain't it funny what you'll do

When the zeros line up on the 24 hour clock
When you know who's calling even though the number is blocked
When you walked around your house wearing my sky blue Lacoste
And your knee socks

The late afternoon
The ghost in your room that you always thought didn't approve of you knocking boots
Never stopped you letting me get hold of the sweet spot by the scruff of your
Knee socks

You and me could have been a team
Each had a half of a king and queen seat
Like the beginning of Mean Streets
You could Be My Baby
[4x]

(All the zeros lined up but the number's blocked when you've come undone)

Let me be your 'leccy meter and I'll never run out
Let me be the portable heater that you'll get cold without

Star Treatment,Arctic Monkeys,"I just wanted to be one of The Strokes
Now look at the mess you made me make
Hitchhiking with a monogrammed suitcase
Miles away from any half-useful imaginary highway
I'm a big name in deep space, ask your mates
But golden boy's in bad shape
I found out the hard way that
Here ain't no place for dolls like you and me
Everybody's on a barge
Floating down the endless stream of great TV
1984, 2019

Maybe I was a little too wild in the '70s
Rocket-ship grease down the cracks of my knuckles
Karate bandana, warp speed chic
Hair down to there, impressive moustache
Love came in a bottle with a twist-off cap
Let's all have a swig and do a hot lap

So who you gonna call?
The martini police?
Baby, that isn't how they look tonight, oh no
It took the light forever to get to your eyes

I just wanted to be one of those ghosts
You thought that you could forget
And then I haunt you via the rear view mirror
On a long drive from the back seat
But it's alright, 'cause you love me
And you recognise that it's ain't how it should be
Your eyes are heavy and the weather's getting ugly
So pull over, I know the place
Don't you know an apparition is a cheap date?
What exactly is it you've been drinking these days?
Jukebox in the corner, long, hot summer
They've got a film up on the wall and it's dark enough to dance
What do you mean you've never seen Blade Runner?

Oh, maybe I was a little too wild in the '70s
Back down to earth with a lounge singer shimmer
Elevator down to my make-believe residency
From the honeymoon suite
Two shows a day, four nights a week
Easy money

So who you gonna call?
The martini police?
So who you gonna call?
The martini police?
Oh, baby, that isn't how they look tonight
It took the light absolutely forever to get to your eyes

One Point Perspective,Arctic Monkeys,"Dancing in my underpants
I'm gonna run for government
I'm gonna form a covers band and all
Back there by the baby grand
Did Mr. Winter Wonderland say
""Come here kid, we really need to talk""?
Bear with me, man, I lost my train of thought

I fantasize I call it quits
I swim with the economists
And I get to the bottom of it for good
By the time reality hits
The chimes of freedom fell to bits
The shining city on the fritz
They come out of the cracks
Thirsty for blood

Just as the apocalypse finally gets prioritized
And you cry some of the hottest tears you ever cried
Multiplied by five
I suppose a singer must die

""Singsong 'round the money tree""
This stunning documentary that no one else unfortunately saw

American Sports,Arctic Monkeys,"So when you gaze at planet Earth from outer space
Does it wipe that stupid look off of your face?

I lost the money, lost the keys
But I'm still handcuffed to the briefcase

And I never thought, not in a million year
That I'd meet so many Lolas
Can I please have my money back?
My virtual reality mask is stuck on ‘Parliament Brawl’
Emergency battery pack, just in time for my weekly chat
With God on video call

Breaking news, they take the truth and make it fluid
The trainer's explanation was accepted by the steward
A montage of the latest ancient ruins
Soundtracked by a chorus of ""You don't know what you're doing""

And I never thought, not in a million years
That I'd meet so many Lolas

And all of my most muscular regrets
Explode behind my eyes like American sports

And I never thought, not in a million year
That I'd meet so many Lolas"

Golden Trunks,Arctic Monkeys,"Last night when my psyche's subcommittee sang to me in it's scary voice
You slowly dropped your eyelids
When true love takes a grip it leaves you without a choice

And in response to what you whispered in my ear
I must admit sometimes I fantasize about you too

He's got himself a theme tune
They play it for him as he makes his way to the ring

And in response to what you whispered in my ear
I must admit sometimes I fantasize about you too

Swamp monster with a hard-on for connectivity
The ascension of the C.R.E.A.M
Mass panic on a not too distant future colony
Quantitative easing

I want to make a simple point about peace and love
But in a sexy way where it's not obvious
Highlight dangers and send out hidden messages
The way some science fiction does

I've got the world on a wire in my little mirror mirror on the wall
In the pocket of my raincoat

So I tried to write a song to make you blush
But I've a feeling that the whole thing
May well just end up too clever for its own good

(She looks like fun)
Good morning
(She looks like fun)
Cheeseburger
(She looks like fun)
Snowboarding
(She looks like)

Finally, I can share with you through cloudy skies
Every whimsical thought that enters my mind
There's no limit to the length of the dickheads we can be

(She looks like fun)
Bukowski
(She looks like fun)
Dogsitting
(She looks like fun)
Screwballing
(She looks like)

Finally, there's a place where you can wag your tongue
Baby, but why can't we all just get along?
Dance as if somebody's watching, because they are

No one's on the streets
We moved it all online
As of March
I'm so full of shite, I need to spend less time stood around in bars waffling on to strangers
All about martial arts
And how much I respect them

(She looks like fun)
Key changes
(She looks like fun)
Re-thinking
(She looks like fun)
New order
(She looks like fun)"
Batphone,Arctic Monkeys,"I want an interesting synonym to describe this thing
That you say we're all grandfathered in
I'll use the search engine
(We've got much to discuss)
Too much to discuss over a bucket of balls
I can recall the glow of your low beams

It's the big night in Tinsel City
Life became a spectator sport
I launch my fragrance called 'Integrity'
I sell the fact that I can't be bought
Have I told you all about the time that I got sucked into a hole
Through a handheld device?
I will flashback now and again, but I'm usually alright
Thankfully, the process has been simplified
Since the last time you tried

I've recognised the glow of your low beams numerous times
I'll be by the Batphone if you need to get a hold
Making a selection, opening credits roll
Panoramic windows looking out across your soul

You go in through the door
Vengeance trilogy wallpaper walls
They have re-decorated it all
They've changed all the lights and the bar's down the side

I've recognised the glow of your low beams numerous times
Through fairly opaque blinds in the sitting room
Vehicles will pass by, but I know when it's you
I'll be in a nose dive in my flying shoes
Right behind your closed eyes like a memory from your youth
I'll be by the Batphone if you need to get a hold
Making a selection, opening credits roll
Killer Pink Flamingos, computer controlled
Panoramic windows looking out across your soul"
The Ultracheese,Arctic Monkeys,"Still got pictures of friends on the wall
I suppose we aren't really friends anymore
Maybe I shouldn't ever have called that thing friendly at all
Get freaked out from a knock at the door
When I haven't been expecting one
Didn't that used to be part of the fun, once upon a time?
We'll be there at the back of the bar
In a booth like we usually were
Every time there was a rocket launch or some big event

What a death I died writing that song
Start to finish, with you looking on
It stays between us, Steinway and his sons
Because it's the ultracheese
Perhaps it's time that you went for a walk
Dressed like a fictional character
From a place they called America in the golden age
Trust the politics to come along
When you were just trying to orbit the sun
When you were just about to be kind to someone because you have the chance

I've still got pictures of friends on the wall
I might look as if I'm deep in thought
But the truth is I'm probably not
If I ever was

Oh the dawn won't stop weighing a tonne
I've done some things that I shouldn't have done
But I haven't stopped loving you once

Oh..."
There’d Better Be A Mirrorball,Arctic Monkeys,"Don't get emotional, that ain't like you
Yesterday's still leaking through the roof, that's nothing new
I know I promised this is what I wouldn't do
Somehow giving it the old romantic fool
Seems to better suit the mood

So if you wanna walk me to the car
You oughta know I'll have a heavy heart
So can we please be absolutely sure
That there's a mirrorball?

You're getting cynical and that won't do
I'd throw the rose tint back on the exploded view
Darling, if I were you
And how's that insatiable appetite?
For the moment when you look them in the eyes
And say ""Baby, it's been nice""

So do you wanna walk me to the car?
I'm sure to have a heavy heart
So can we please be absolutely sure
That there's a mirrorball for me?
Oh, there'd better be a mirrorball for me"
I Ain’t Quite Where I Think I Am,Arctic Monkeys,"Freaky keypad by the retina scan
I've been given good reason to believe
I ain't quite where I think I am
But it's always worth half a blast
You know the face but you can't see past
The disco strobes in the stumbling blocks
Wait, there's the other island now

Formation displays of affection fly over
(Eyes roll back)
And I can see both islands now

It's the intermission
Let's shake a few hands
Blank expressions invite me to suspect
I ain't quite where I think I am
Stackable party guests to fill the awkward silences
The disco strobes in the stumbling blocks
Wait, there's the other island now

Formation displays of affection fly over
(Eyes roll back)
And I can see both islands now from my vantage point

The spare set of tingles will race up your spine
If I get it my way

Looks like the Riviera is coming in to land
Early predictions would seem to suggest
I ain't quite where I think I am

Formation displays of affection fly over
(Eyes roll back)
And I can see both islands now"
Sculptures Of Anything Goes,Arctic Monkeys,"How am I supposed to manage my infallible beliefs
While I'm sockin' it to ya?
Performing in Spanish on Italian TV
Sometime in the future
Whilst wondering if your mother still ever thinks of me
Hallelujah

Blank canvasses lent against gallery walls
Flowing towards sculptures of Anything Goes
On the marble stairs

Is that vague sense of longing kinda trying to cause a scene?
Guess I'm talking to you now
Puncturing your bubble of relatability
With your horrible new sound
Baby, those mixed messages ain't what they used to be
When you said 'em out loud

Blank canvasses lent against gallery walls
Flowing towards sculptures of Anything Goes
On the marble stairs
Leading to almost wherever you want them to

The simulation cartridge for City Life '09
Is pretty tricky to come by
Village coffee mornings with not long since retired spies
Now that's my idea of a good time
Flash that angle grinder smile, gasp and roll your eyes
And help me to get untied from the chandelier
And twizzling 'round an umbrella
I'll sing a tune"
Jet Skis On The Moat,Arctic Monkeys,"Jet skis on the moat
They shot it all in CinemaScope
As though it's the last time you're gonna ride
Showstoppers anonymous
Come over here and give your buddy a hug
So much for deciding not to let it slide

Is there something on your mind
Or are you just happy to sit there and watch
While the paint job dries?
When it's over, you're supposed to know

Lights out on the Wonderpark
Your sawtoothed lover boy was quick off the mark
That's long enough in the sunshine for one night
Didn't recognise you through the smoke
Pyjama pants and a Subbuteo cloak
You know that it's alright if you wanna cry

Is there something on your mind
Or are you just happy to sit there and watch
While the paint job dries?
When it's over, you're supposed to know

Jet skis on the moat
They shot it all in CinemaScope
As though it's the last time you're gonna ride"
Body Paint,Arctic Monkeys,"For a master of deception and subterfuge
You've made yourself quite the bed, to lie in
Do your time traveling through the tanning booth
So you don't let the sun catch you crying

So predictable, I know what you're thinking

My teeth are beating and my knees are weak
It's as if there's something up with the wiring
You can poke your head behind the mountain peak
It don't have to mean that you've gone into hiding

So predictable, I know what you're thinking

I'm watching your every move
I feel the tears are coming on
It won't be long
It won't be long

Straight from the cover shoot
There's still a trace of body paint
On your legs and on your arms and on your face
And I'm keeping on my costume
And calling it a writing tool
And if you're thinking of me
I'm probably thinking of you

There's still a trace of body paint
On your legs and on your arms and on your face
There's still a trace of body paint
On your legs and on your arms and on your face
There's still a trace of body paint
On your legs and on your arms and on your face
There's still a trace of body paint
On your legs and on your arms and on your face
So predictable, I know what you're thinking

The Car,Arctic Monkeys,
Big Ideas,Arctic Monkeys,"That's quite a number to sing
Spot lit getting lowered in
Can you co-direct and play the twins?
And adapt the main theme for mandolins?
I've conjured up wonderful things
The Ballad of What Could Have Been
Over and out
It's been a thrill

I had big ideas, the band was so excited
The kind you'd rather not share over the phone
But now the orchestra's got us all surrounded
And I cannot for the life of me remember how they go

Co-ordinated release
Nationwide festivities
We had 'em out of their seats
Waving their arms and stomping their feet
Some just hysterical scenes
The Ballad of What Could Have Been
Over and out
Really it's been a thrill

I had big ideas, the band was so excited
The kind you'd rather not share over the phone
But now the orchestra's got us all surrounded
And I cannot for the life of me remember how they go
I just can't for the life of me remember how they go"
Hello You,Arctic Monkeys,"Lego Napoleon movie written in noble gas-filled glass tubes underlined in sparks
I'll admit it's elaborate for a waking thought
Vortex to vortex, The Business they call Show
Hasn't ever been this pumped up before
Hello Gruesome, there's just enough time left to swing by and re-address the start
If you call and have them pull around the car and stop specialising in stories from the road

Hello you
Still dragging out a long goodbye?
I ought to apologise
For one of the last times

As that meandering chapter reaches its end and leaves us in a thoughtful little daze
This electric warrior's motorcade shall burn no more rubber down that boulevard
Read the message I left on the thank you card
Overtaking the tractor, waiting for sets of winds and bends to level out again
Picking your moment along a country lane
The kind where the harmonies feel right at home

Hello you
Still dragging out a long goodbye?
I ought to apologise
For one of the last times

Taking a dive into your crystal ball
I've snorkelled on the beaches fruitlessly
Why not rewind to Rawborough Snooker Club?
I could pass for seventeen if I
Just get a shave and catch some Zzz"
Mr Schwartz,Arctic Monkeys,"Put your heavy metal to the test
Might be half a love song in it all for you
Timing wise it's probably for the best
Come here and kiss me now before it gets too cute

Mr. Schwartz is staying strong for the crew
Wardrobe's lint rolling your velveteen suit
And smudging dubbin on your dancing shoes

Gradually it's coming into view
It's like your little directorial debut
As fine a time as any to deduce
The fact that neither you or I has ever had a clue

Mr. Schwartz is staying strong for the crew
Wardrobe's lint rolling your velveteen suit
And smudging dubbin on your dancing shoes

And if we guess who I'm pretending to be
Do we win a prize?
Having attempted twice, both incorrectly
Do we get a third try?

The gloved hand's reaching in to hit the switch
And there's not one goddam thing that you can do about it

Mr. Schwartz is having tea with the grips
Asking after all the wives and the kids
It's at the heart of what The Business is"
Perfect Sense,Arctic Monkeys,"Richard of York: The Executive Branch
Having some fun with the warm-up act
If that's what it takes to say goodnight
Then that's what it takes

A four figure sum on a hotel notepad
A revelation or your money back
That's what it takes to say goodnight
Sometimes I wrap my head around it all and it makes perfect sense

Keep reminding me that it ain't a race
When my invincible streak turns onto the final straight
If that's what it takes to say goodnight
Then that's what it takes"
Put It on a T-Shirt,The Vaccines,"Help me make my mind up then as you're tying up my shoes
My ego sang me lullabies and my conscience sang the blues
It took me to a crossroads once and said I had a choice
But he couldn't hear me make my bed over his own voice
So if I climb the mountain now in my patent leather shoes
And I touch the hand of God up there, will you still help me choose?

They tried to tell me you were cold
And you're impossible to hurt
Now I've heard that said about the both of us
They should put it on a T-shirt
If that's true about the both of us
They should put it on a T-shirt

Yes, I got your article on the shape of things to come
I'm glad you're feeling guilty now that you're better off than some
But I think you sent donations to the wrong side of the road
So I took 'em from their window sill and served 'em à la mode

They tried to tell me you were cold
But they would eat you for dessert
Now I've heard that said about the both of us
They should put it on a T-shirt
If that's true about the both of us
They should put it on a T-shirt
La-da-da, la-da-da-da-da
They should put it on a T-shirt
La-da-da, la da-da-da-da
Why don't they put it on a T-shirt?

Help me make my mind up then as you're tying up my shoes
My ego sang me lullabies and my conscience sang the blues
I'm sleeping in the kitchen now, her feet are in the hall
My picture's on her piano, my head is off the wall

They tried to tell me you were cold
And you're impossible to hurt
Now I've heard that said about the both of us
They should put it on a T-shirt
If that's true about the both of us
They should put it on a T-shirt
If that's true about the both of us
They should put it on a T-shirt
If that's true about the both of us
Why don't they put it on a T-shirt?"
I Can't Quit,The Vaccines,"Hangin' around, hittin' the ground, dead in the water

Takin' a hit, this is it, I'm over it

I can't quit
I'm over it

Shutting it up, cutting me up with broken glasses
Heaven above, been learning to love in evening classes
Get a new man and go to work out with your sister
Talk in a bit, but this it, I'm over it

I can't quit
I'm over it
I can't quit
I'm over it

You can't change me, can you?
You can't offer that much to me
Oh you can't offer change, can you?
And I can't offer that much to you

Havin' it out, livin' in doubt with no defenses
Tighten the rope, and talkin' of hope in different tenses
Callin' my friends and tellin' the only one that answers
It's hard to admit, but this it, I'm over it

I can't quit

Surfing in the Sky,The Vaccines,"How many light bulbs does it take to change the mood?
If that's how many did, I think I'm screwed
And how many problems can you fit in your limousine?
Let's take 'em 'round the back to the cash machine

And if my eyes open for business
Or my heart comes home for Christmas
Then I will take you surfing in the sky
No, I can't walk on water
And if you've ever wondered why
Let me take you surfing in the sky

What do you get when you cross the Rubicon?
With a man whose sense of humor has all gone?
You tell him the one about the one that gets away
So when you take your shot and there's no one left to play

And you've got nothing left to give
I'll give you a month to live
And I will take you surfing in the sky
To keep you out of reach of every other guy
I will take you surfing in the sky
Whoa

I was made to measure
The fastest way to pleasure
So I can take you surfing in the sky
Some say ""hallelujah""
Some, not even ""hi""
So baby let's go surfing in the sky
Baby let's go surfing in the sky
Baby let's go surfing in the sky"

Maybe I want to spend my life with you

Lost it by playing you wide
That's the luck of the draw

Nightclub,The Vaccines,"I wake up in the morning with the evening in my eye
And by the time I get there, it becomes apparent why
All the voices singing to me, like some sort of choir
That you can't fight fire with the feeling of desire
So I become a bubble-bath for my sociopath
But with the God-given right of the socialite
She said she only thinks of love like a long weekend
But she might jump in if I show her to the deep end

Yeah
And it makes my head feel like a nightclub
It makes my head feel like a nightclub
It makes my head feel like a nightclub
It makes my head

She says that if I wanted romance I could find it in the past
But if I wanna face the music then I only have to ask
So she sings me one I know as if we're sittin' 'round the fire
And there ain't no feeling like the feeling of desire

Yeah
And it makes my head feel like a nightclub
It makes my head feel like a nightclub
It makes my head feel like a nightclub
It makes my head

It makes my head feel like a nightclub
It makes my head feel like a nightclub

Hear me out! I'm out on the street
And I'm trying to find your building, baby

I'm not in love but can we just pretend?
I thought of her, I thought of you
I thought it through and then I called you
I'm not in love but can we just pretend?
I thought of her, I thought of you
I thought it through and then I called you

You told me I'm hard to live with
But you said it out of spite
I may put you through some suffering

It's a chapter that you're stuck on
And you'd rather read alone
I'm an uninspiring ending
But the best you've ever known

Rolling Stones,The Vaccines,"When your mouth is as big as the Rolling Stones
And your self-control, a relative unknown

I know you paid for the room with a view
But got one that pointed at you
So when you skip to the front of the queue
You can tell them that this one's for you
Yeah, tell them that this one's for you

I know people think your mind is a ski resort
But the art of deception is a contact sport

So if you wanna make amends then you make a list
You don't draw blanks on the back of your fist
In the restaurant at the top of your ivory tower
Where the room stopped turning just to save on power

But if you ask her politely enough
Or you kick up enough of a fuss
Then the world might revolve around us
Yeah, the world should revolve around us

And if there's no reservation for two
But the hostess is someone you knew
Then skip to the front of the queue
And tell them that this one's for you
Go tell them that this one's for you

But when I float to the top, it's on a lucky guess
But I only go fishing for negative press
'Cause I've been to the bottom and the bottom is frayed
But the easy way out ain't tailor-made

And I've been to the bottom with you
Where we just do what we want to do
So let's skip to the front of the queue

We'll tell them that this one's for you"

Fear by name than love by numbers
Street lamp amber wanderlust
Powder in a blunderbuss

And suddenly the sky is a scissor
Sitting on the floor with a tambourine
Crushing up a bundle of love
Don't take it so personally
You're not the only one
That time's got it in for honey
That's where you're wrong

All the old flames fastened on
Make a wish that weighs a tonne
There are no handles that you can hold
And no understanding where it goes

Sitting on the floor with a tambourine
Crushing up a bundle of love
